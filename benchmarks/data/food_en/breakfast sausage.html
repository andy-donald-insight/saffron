<b>Breakfast sausage</b> (or <b>country sausage</b>) is a type of fresh <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> usually served at breakfast in the United States.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.mrbreakfast.com/w_ireland.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrbreakfast.com/w_ireland.asp</a>|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=Breakfast In Ireland – MrBreakfast.com}}&#60;/ref&#62; It is a common breakfast item in traditional American &#34;farmer&#34; or &#34;country&#34; breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Often, scraps and trimmings that would ordinarily have been fed to a dog or discarded were instead ground, seasoned, refrigerated and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}</p>
<p>It is perhaps most popular for home consumption in rural regions, especially in the southern states, where it is in the form of fresh or <a href="/Smoking_(cooking)" title="Smoking (cooking)">smoked</a> patties or links (the latter with natural casings, synthetic casings, or no casing at all). Most diners, fast-food restaurants, and family restaurants across the country will also offer one or more versions of it during breakfast hours, whether on a sandwich, in a breakfast platter, or both; some fine-dining establishments will also have a sausage option on their breakfast or brunch menu.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/breakfast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/breakfast.html</a>|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=Breakfast :: McDonalds.com}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.dbbistro.com/nyc/breakfast/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbbistro.com/nyc/breakfast/</a>|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=BREAKFAST - DB Bistro - New York City}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/pdfs/OscarBreakfastJune2013.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/pdfs/OscarBreakfastJune2013.pdf</a>|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=www.waldorfnewyork.com/pdfs/OscarBreakfastJune2013.pdf}}&#60;/ref&#62; The cased link variety is most similar to English-style sausages and has been made in the United States since colonial days.  It is essentially highly seasoned <a href="/Ground_meat" title="Ground meat">ground meat</a>, so it does not keep and should be stored and handled appropriately.
