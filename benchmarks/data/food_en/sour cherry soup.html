<p>In Hungarian cuisine, sour cherry soup&#60;ref name=&#34;Meyers&#34; /&#62; or <i>meggyleves</i> is a soup made from the fruits of the sour cherry tree (<i>Prunus cerasus</i>), and not from sweet cherries. The name is formed from <i>hideg</i> meaning &#39;cold&#39;, <i>meggy</i> meaning &#39;sour-cherries&#39; / morellos, and <i>leves</i> meaning &#39;soup&#39;. It is traditionally served as a dinner course, usually as either the <a href="/Appetizer" title="Appetizer">appetizer</a>, <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> or <a href="/Dessert" title="Dessert">dessert</a>, on warm summer nights or for hot summer luncheons.
