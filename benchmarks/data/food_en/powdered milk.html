<b>Powdered milk</b> or <b>dried milk</b> is a manufactured <a href="/Dairy_product" title="Dairy product">dairy product</a> made by evaporating <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> to <a href="/Drying_(food)" title="Drying (food)">dryness</a>. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">shelf life</a> than liquid milk and does not need to be <a href="/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigerated</a>, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat (skimmed) dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry <a href="/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a> products and dry dairy blends.  Many dairy products exported conform to standards laid out in  <a href="/Codex_Alimentarius" title="Codex Alimentarius">Codex Alimentarius</a>. Many forms of milk powder are traded on <a href="/Exchange_(organized_market)" title="Exchange (organized market)">exchanges</a>.</p>
