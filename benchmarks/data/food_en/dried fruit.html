<p>Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of <a href="/Mediterranean_diet" title="Mediterranean diet">Mediterranean diets</a> for millennia.

<p>The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1700 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in <a href="/Akkadian_Empire" title="Akkadian Empire">Akkadian</a>, the daily language of <a href="/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, were inscribed in <a href="/Cuneiform" title="Cuneiform">cuneiform</a> and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, <a href="/Pomegranate" title="Pomegranate">pomegranates</a>, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> for the palaces and temples. Because cuneiform was very complex and only scribes who had studied for years could read it, it is unlikely that the tablets were meant for everyday cooks or chefs. Instead they were written to document the culinary art of the times. Many recipes are quite elaborate and have rare ingredients so we may assume that they represent &#34;Mediterranean haute cuisine&#34;.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Date_palm" title="Date palm">date palm</a> was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50&#38;nbsp;kg (100&#38;nbsp;lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable they were well recorded in <a href="/Assyria" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.</p>

<p>Figs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, <a href="/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="/Crete" title="Crete">Crete</a>, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.</p>
<p>Grape cultivation first began in <a href="/Armenia" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Here, raisins were manufactured by burying grapes in the desert sun. Very quickly, <a href="/Viticulture" title="Viticulture">viticulture</a> and raisin production spread across northern Africa including <a href="/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. The <a href="/Phoenicians" title="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> and the <a href="/Egyptians" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also included them in their breads and their various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.</p>
<p>From the <a href="/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, these fruits spread through Greece to <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> where they became a major part of the diet. <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Romans</a> ate raisins in spectacular quantities and all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes as well as premium barter currency.</p>

<p>Having dried fruits was a must in ancient <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: &#34;She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture19/r_19-2.html" rel="nofollow">Cato, (M.P.) &#34;On Agriculture&#34;.

<p>Figs again were extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were equated with bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars.</p>
<p><a href="/Plum" title="Plum">Plums</a>, <a href="/Apricot" title="Apricot">apricots</a> and <a href="/Peach" title="Peach">peaches</a> had their origins in <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture12/lec12.html" rel="nofollow">Janick J. &#34;History of Horticulture&#34; (2002)</a>, retrieved 2011-12-19&#60;/ref&#62; They were domesticated in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.</p>

<p>Today, dried fruit is produced in most regions of the world, and consumption occurs in all cultures and demographic segments. In the United States, Americans consumed an average of {{convert|2.18|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (processed weight) of dried fruit in 2006. <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">Raisins</a> accounted for about two thirds of this.&#60;ref&#62;United States Department of Agriculture. &#34;Fruit and Tree Nut Situation and Outlook: A Report from the Economic Research Service&#34; <a class="external free" href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/FTS&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/FTS&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; <a href="/California" title="California">California</a> produces the largest percentage of the US and the world&#39;s{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} dried fruit crop.

Most of California dried fruit production is centered in the San Joaquin Valley where the soil and climate, especially the hot, dry summers, provide ideal growing conditions. While these fruits were commonly dried in the sun in the past, now only raisins are almost entirely naturally sun-dried.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/fruits" rel="nofollow">Agricultural Marketing Resource Center at Iowa State University. &#34;Fruits&#34;</a>, retrieved 2011-12-19&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Fruits can be dried whole (e.g., grapes, berries, apricot, plum), in halves, or as slices, (e.g., mango, papaya, kiwi). Alternatively they can be chopped after drying (e.g., dates), made into pastes, or concentrated juices. The residual moisture content can vary from small (3 – 8%) to substantial (16 – 18%), depending on the type of fruit. Fruits can also be dried in puree form, as leather,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/uga/uga_dry_fruit.pdf" rel="nofollow">National Center for Home Food Preservation—&#34;Drying Fruits and Vegetables&#34;</a>, accessed 28 June 2009&#60;/ref&#62; or as a powder, by spray of drum drying.

Dried fruit is widely used by the confectionery, baking, and sweets industries. Food manufacturing plants use dried fruits in various sauces, soups, marinades, garnishes, puddings, and food for infants and children.</p>

</div>

<p>
<a href="/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">Sulfur dioxide</a> is used as an <a href="/Antioxidant" title="Antioxidant">antioxidant</a> in some dried fruits to protect their color and flavor. For example, in golden raisins, dried peaches, apples and apricots sulfur dioxide is used to keep them from losing their light color by blocking browning reactions that darken fruit and alter their flavor. Over the years, sulfur dioxide and <a href="/Sulfite" title="Sulfite">sulfites</a> have been used by many populations for a variety of purposes. Sulfur dioxide was first employed as a food additive in 1664, and was later approved for such use in the United States as far back as the 1800s.</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide, while harmless to healthy individuals, can induce <a href="/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> when inhaled or ingested by sensitive people. The <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) estimates that one out of a hundred people is sulfite-sensitive (allergic), and about 5% of asthmatics are also at risk of suffering an adverse reaction. Given that about 10% of the population suffers from asthma, this figure translates to 0.5% of the whole population with potential for sulfite-sensitivity. These individuals make up the subgroup of greatest concern and are largely aware of the need to avoid sulfite-containing foods. Consequently, the FDA requires food manufactures and processors to disclose the presence of sulfiting agents in concentrations of at least 10 <a href="/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">parts per million</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/FieldScience/ucm172545.htm" rel="nofollow">Food and Drug Administration, <i>Science &#38; Research Volume IV: Food and Color Additives</i></a>, retrieved 2011-12-19&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Traditional dried fruit have a low to moderate Glycemic Index (GI) – a measure of how a food affects blood sugar levels. GI measures an individual&#39;s response to eating a <a href="/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>-containing food (usually 50&#38;nbsp;grams of available carbohydrates) compared to the individual&#39;s response to the same amount of carbohydrates from either white bread or glucose. Carbohydrate containing foods are classified as high (above 70), moderate (56–69), or low (0–55) GI.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.glycemicindex.com/" rel="nofollow">The Glycemic Index and GI Database, University of Sydney</a>, retrieved 2011-12-19&#60;/ref&#62; Foods with high fiber content generally have a low GI. However, other factors also contribute to a food&#39;s glycemic response, such as the type of carbohydrate or sugar present, the physical characteristic of the food matrix and the presence of organic acids. All studies assessing the GI of dried fruit show that they are low to moderate GI foods and that the <a href="/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a> response is proportional to their GI. Factors thought to contribute to this glycemic response include the viscous texture of dried fruits when chewed; their whole food matrix; the presence of phenolic compounds and organic acids and the type of sugar present (about 50% fructose in most <a href="/Traditional_dried_fruit" title="Traditional dried fruit">traditional dried fruit</a>).&#60;ref&#62;Kim Y et al. &#34;Raisins are a low to moderate glycemic index food with a corresponding low insulin index&#34; <i>Nutr Res</i> 2008; 28:304–308&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
