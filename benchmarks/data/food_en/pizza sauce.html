<p><b>Tomato sauce</b> refers to any of a very large number of sauces made primarily from <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomatoes</a>, usually to be served as part of a <a href="/Dish_(food)" title="Dish (food)">dish</a> (rather than as a <a href="/Condiment" title="Condiment">condiment</a>). Tomato sauces are common for <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a> and <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, but they are perhaps best known as sauces for <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a> dishes.</p>
<p>Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high liquid content, very soft flesh which breaks down easily, and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of thickeners such as <a href="/Roux" title="Roux">roux</a>). All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces. The simplest tomato sauces consist just of chopped tomato flesh cooked in a little <a href="/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> and <a href="/Simmering" title="Simmering">simmered</a> until it loses its raw flavor, and seasoned with <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a>.</p>
<p>Optionally tomato skins may be scalded and peeled according to texture (especially thicker <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pelati">pelati</a></i> paste varieties) and tomato seeds may be removed to avoid their bitterness.</p>
<p>Water (or another, more flavorful liquid such as <a href="/Stock_(food)" title="Stock (food)">stock</a> or <a href="/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>) is sometimes added to keep it from drying out too much. <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">Onion</a> and <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a> are almost always <a href="/Sweating_(cooking)" title="Sweating (cooking)">sweated</a> or <a href="/Saut%C3%A9ing" title="Sautéing">sautéed</a> at the beginning before the tomato is added. Other seasonings typically include <a href="/Basil" title="Basil">basil</a>, <a href="/Oregano" title="Oregano">oregano</a>, <a href="/Parsley" title="Parsley">parsley</a>, and possibly some spicy <a href="/Capsicum" title="Capsicum">red pepper</a> or <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">black pepper</a>. Ground or chopped meat is also common.
In countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the term &#34;tomato sauce&#34; is used to describe a condiment type table sauce similar to that known in the United States as &#34;<a href="/Ketchup" title="Ketchup">ketchup</a>.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://journals.worldnomads.com/leah/gallery/13544/384186.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://journals.worldnomads.com/leah/gallery/13544/384186.aspx</a> |title=traditional aussie meat pie with ketchup (or tomato sauce, as they would say) - perth - Australia - Leah Down Under - WorldNomads Adventures |publisher=Journals.worldnomads.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&#60;/ref&#62; In some of these countries, both terms are used for the condiment.</p>
<p>The use of tomato sauce with pasta appears for the first time in the Italian cookbook <i>L&#39;Apicio moderno</i>, by Roman chef <a href="/Francesco_Leonardi_(Chef)" title="Francesco Leonardi (Chef)">Francesco Leonardi</a>, edited in 1790.&#60;ref&#62;<i>L&#39;Arte della cucina in Italia</i>, Emilio Faccioli, Einaudi, Milano, 1987&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The misconception that the tomato has been central to <a href="/Italian_cuisine" title="Italian cuisine">Italian cuisine</a> since its introduction from the <a href="/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a> is often repeated. Though the tomato was introduced from the Spanish New World to European <a href="/Botanist" title="Botanist">botanists</a> in the 16th century, tomato sauce made a relatively late entry in Italian cuisine: in <a href="/Antonio_Latini" title="Antonio Latini">Antonio Latini</a>&#39;s cookbook <i>Lo scalco alla moderna</i> (Naples, 1692).&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Elizabeth_David" title="Elizabeth David">Elizabeth David</a>, <i>Italian Food</i> (1954, 1999), p 319, and John Dickie, <i>Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food</i>, 2008, p. 162.&#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>Latini was chef to the Spanish viceroy of Naples, and one of his tomato recipes is for sauce <i>alla spagnuola</i>, &#34;in the Spanish style&#34;. The use of tomato sauce with pasta appears for the first time in the Italian cookbook <i>L&#39;Apicio moderno</i>, by Roman chef <a href="/Francesco_Leonardi_(Chef)" title="Francesco Leonardi (Chef)">Francesco Leonardi</a>, edited in 1790.</p>
<p>Italian varieties of tomato sauce range from the very simple <a href="/Pasta_al_pomodoro" title="Pasta al pomodoro">pasta al pomodoro</a> to the piquant <a href="/Puttanesca" title="Puttanesca">puttanesca</a> and <a href="/Arrabbiata" title="Arrabbiata">arrabbiata</a> sauces. Tomato sauce with pasta can stand on its own or it can also be paired with ingredients such as Italian sausage, shrimp, meatballs or vegetables, for a more lively pasta dish.</p>

<p>Tomato sauce was an ancient condiment in <a href="/Aztec" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> food. The first western person to write of what may have been a tomato sauce was <a href="/Bernardino_de_Sahag%C3%BAn" title="Bernardino de Sahagún">Bernardino de Sahagún</a>, who made note of a prepared sauce that was offered for sale in the markets of <a href="/Tenochtitlan" title="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a> (<a href="/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> today). Spaniards later brought the use of tomatoes to Europe.</p>
<p>Basic Mexican tomato sauces are tomato sauce (salsa de tomate rojo o jitomate) and <a href="/Green_sauce" title="Green sauce">green sauce</a> (salsa de tomate verde). The tomato sauce is stock for spicy sauces and <a href="/Mole_(sauce)" title="Mole (sauce)">moles</a>.</p>

<p>In the U.S., &#34;tomato sauce&#34; refers to two distinct sauces. One is a tomato concentrate with salt and minimal herbs, used in cooking.  This product is considered incomplete and not normally used as is. Related ingredients are <a href="/Tomato_pur%C3%A9e" title="Tomato purée">tomato purée</a> and <a href="/Tomato_paste" title="Tomato paste">tomato paste</a>, each of which is similar but of a thicker consistency.  Tomato purée and tomato paste have FDA standards of identity (since 1939) for percentage of tomato solids, and generally do not contain seasonings other than salt; tomato sauce is nonstandardized.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://contadina.com/tips-advice/faq.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://contadina.com/tips-advice/faq.aspx</a> |title=Contadina – Tips &#38; Advice – Contadina FAQs |publisher=Contadina.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The second use of the term &#34;tomato sauce&#34; in the U.S. is for a cooked sauce of tomatoes, usually containing olive oil and garlic. This type of tomato sauce is generally served with pasta, and sometimes with meat. Less commonly, it is served with chicken or beef alone. One popular variety of tomato sauce is <i><a href="/Marinara_sauce" title="Marinara sauce">marinara sauce</a>, </i>an Italian-American term for a simple tomato sauce with herbs—mostly parsley and basil. </p>
<p>Contrary to what the name might suggest (&#39;marinara&#39; is Italian for &#34;sailor-style&#34;) it is without anchovies, fish, or seafood. In Italy, marinara refers either to sauces made with tomato and garlic (as in pizza marinara) or to seafood-based sauces or foods; in this case, the name does not imply that tomato is either included or excluded.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/Italian_American" title="Italian American">Italian Americans</a> on the <a href="/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a> and around the <a href="/Chicago_area" title="Chicago area">Chicago area</a> refer to tomato sauce as &#34;<a href="/Gravy" title="Gravy">gravy</a>&#34;, &#34;tomato gravy&#34;, or &#34;Sunday gravy&#34;, especially sauces with a large quantity of meat simmered in them, similar to the Italian <a href="/Neapolitan_rag%C3%B9" title="Neapolitan ragù">Neapolitan ragù</a>. The term &#34;Sunday gravy&#34; derives from the Italian tradition of having a large, family dinner on Sunday afternoons. &#34;Gravy&#34; is an erroneous English translation from the Italian <i>sugo</i> which means juice, but can also mean sauce (as in <i>sugo per pastasciutta</i>).&#60;ref&#62;Love, C., <i>Webster&#39;s New World Italian Dictionary, Concise Edition</i> (Macmillan 1991) <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0139536396" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0139536396">ISBN 0-13-953639-6</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The expression for &#34;gravy&#34; in Italian is <i>sugo d&#39;arrosto</i>, which is literally &#34;juice of a roast&#34; and is not specifically tomato sauce.&#60;ref&#62;Love, C., <i>Webster&#39;s New World Italian Dictionary, Concise Edition</i> (Macmillan 1991) <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0139536396" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0139536396">ISBN 0-13-953639-6</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  <a href="/Sicilian_American" title="Sicilian American">Sicilian Americans</a> in communities like <a href="/Buffalo%2C_NY" title="Buffalo, NY">Buffalo</a> and <a href="/Rochester%2C_New_York" title="Rochester, New York">Rochester</a>, <a href="/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> use the terms &#34;<i>sarsa</i>&#34; and &#34;<i>succu</i>&#34; interchangeably for tomato sauces of all types used with pasta, and &#34;gravy&#34; only in reference to brown meat gravies.</p>
<p>American supermarkets commonly carry a variety of prepared tomato sauces described as &#34;spaghetti sauce&#34; or &#34;pasta sauce.&#34; Common variations include meat sauce, marinara sauce, and sauces with <a href="/Edible_mushroom" title="Edible mushroom">mushrooms</a> or sweet red peppers.</p>

It is typically served over white rice. In <a href="/Louisiana_Creole_cuisine" title="Louisiana Creole cuisine">Louisiana Creole cuisine</a>, there is a tomato sauce known as a Creole sauce.
