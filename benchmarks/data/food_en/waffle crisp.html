<b>Waffle Crisp</b> is a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> made by <a href="/Post_Foods" title="Post Foods">Post Foods</a>, which contains <a href="/Maple_syrup" title="Maple syrup">maple syrup</a>-flavored corn cereal bits in a waffle shape. It was first launched in 1996. In 2013, Post introduced a lower-priced version of the cereal, &#34;Waffle Crunch,&#34; as part of their Good MOREnings line of budget cereals.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mascots">Mascots</span></h2>
<p>The original Waffle Crisp mascots were a group of elderly women, dubbed &#34;grannies&#34;, who purportedly cooked each individual piece as if it were an actual, miniature-sized waffle. Most of the commercials for Waffle Crisp from the late 1990s featured preteen kids attempting to break into the (surprisingly high-tech) factory to steal the cereal&#39;s <a href="/Secret_recipe_(disambiguation)" title="Secret recipe (disambiguation)">secret recipe</a> or, at the very least, get a large quantity of Waffle Crisp for themselves (in other words, steal one box of this cereal).</p>
<p>The next mascot was an anthropomorphic waffle with red <a href="/Tennis_shoes" title="Tennis shoes">tennis shoes</a> dubbed &#34;Waffle Boy&#34;. He defends the cereal against a cartoon villain known as Professor Burnt Toast.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Video_games">Video games</span></h2>
<p>Postopia.com, Post&#39;s official website for children, created a Waffle Boy-themed <a href="/Video_game" title="Video game">video game</a> called <i>Waffle Boy&#39;s Extreme Bike Mountain Adventure</i>. It takes place in the jungle where Professor Burnt Toast has stolen the Precious Waffle Crisp, and Waffle Boy goes to retrieve it. A sequel game was made, entitled <i>Waffle Boy&#39;s Jungle Adventure</i>. In this game, Professor Burnt Toast has created a machine that will destroy it all.</p>
<p>However, Waffle Boy was later replaced in the video game series by a dinosaur named &#34;Bronk&#34;, and its plot involves him protecting the secret existence of a fictional race of <a href="/Dinosaur" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a> dubbed as &#34;platosaurs&#34;.</p>
