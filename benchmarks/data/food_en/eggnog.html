The origins, <a href="/Etymology" title="Etymology">etymology</a>, and the ingredients used to make the original eggnog drink are debated. Eggnog may have originated in <a href="/East_Anglia" title="East Anglia">East Anglia</a>, <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>; or it may have simply developed from <a href="/Posset" title="Posset">posset</a>, a <a href="/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> beverage made with hot milk;&#60;ref name=HistEggNog&#62;{{cite web |first=Nanna |last=Rögnvaldardóttir |author2=Linda Stradley |title=History of Eggnog |work=What&#39;s Cooking America |url= |accessdate=2011-12-13 }}&#60;/ref&#62; eggs were added to some posset recipes. The &#34;nog&#34; part of its name may stem from the word <i><a href="/Noggin_(cup)" title="Noggin (cup)">noggin</a></i>, a <a href="/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a> term for a small, carved wooden mug used to serve alcohol.&#60;ref name=HistEggNog&#62;{{cite web |first=Nanna |last=Rögnvaldardóttir |author2=Linda Stradley |title=History of Eggnog |work=What&#39;s Cooking America |url= |accessdate=2006-12-16 }}&#60;/ref&#62; However, the British drink was also called an <i><a href="/Flip_(cocktail)" title="Flip (cocktail)">Egg Flip</a></i>, from the practice of &#34;flipping&#34; (rapidly pouring) the mixture between two pitchers to mix it.</p>
<p>One very early example: Isaac Weld, Junior, in his book <i>Travels Through the States of North America and the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during the years 1795, 1796, and 1797</i> (published in 1800) wrote: &#34;The American travellers, before they pursued their journey, took a hearty draught each, according to custom, of egg-nog, a mixture composed of new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together;...&#34;</p>

<p>The drink crossed the <a href="/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, <a href="/Rum" title="Rum">rum</a> from the <a href="/Triangular_Trade" title="Triangular Trade">Triangular Trade</a> with the <a href="/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> was a cost-effective substitute.&#60;ref name=HistEggNog&#62;{{cite web |first=Nanna |last=Rögnvaldardóttir |author2=Linda Stradley |title=History of Eggnog |work=What&#39;s Cooking America |url= |accessdate=2011-12-13 }}&#60;/ref&#62; The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm and dairy products, helped the drink become very popular in America.&#60;ref name=KPHist&#62;{{cite web |last=Block |first=Stephen |title=The History of Egg Nog |work=Food History |publisher=The Kitchen Project |url= |accessdate=2006-12-16}}&#60;/ref&#62; When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced as a consequence of the <a href="/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually <a href="/Bourbon_whisky" title="Bourbon whisky">bourbon</a> in particular, as a substitute.&#60;ref name=HistEggNog&#62;{{cite web |first=Nanna |last=Rögnvaldardóttir |author2=Linda Stradley |title=History of Eggnog |work=What&#39;s Cooking America |url= |accessdate=2011-12-13 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Traditional eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, an alcoholic spirit, and <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a>, often vanilla or <a href="/Nutmeg" title="Nutmeg">nutmeg</a>. Some modern commercial eggnogs add <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> and other thickeners, with less egg and cream. There are variations in ingredients, and toppings may be added.</p>
<p>Eggnog can be made commercially, as well as domestically. Ready-made eggnog versions are seasonally available with different spirits, or without alcohol, to be drunk as bought or used as &#34;mixes&#34; with all the ingredients except the liquor, to be added as desired.</p>

Some North American manufacturers offer soy-, almond-, rice- or coconut-milk-based alternatives for <a href="/Vegans" title="Vegans">vegans</a> and those with <a href="/Milk_allergy" title="Milk allergy">dairy allergies</a>.</p>
<p>The history of non-dairy eggnogs goes back to at least 1899 when Almeda Lambert, in her <i>Guide for Nut Cookery</i>, gave a recipe for &#34;Egg Nog&#34; made using coconut cream, eggs, and sugar.</p>
<p>In 1973, Eunice Farmilant, in <i>The Natural Foods Sweet-Tooth Cookbook</i>, gave a more modern
non-dairy eggnog recipe using 3 eggs separated, 2 tablespoons of barley malt extract or <a href="/Amasake" title="Amasake">Amasake</a> syrup, 4 cups of chilled soy milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and nutmeg, (p.&#38;nbsp;138-39)</p>
<p>In December 1981, Grain Country of Los Angeles, California, introduced Grain Nog, the earliest known non-dairy and vegan eggnog. Based on amazake (a traditional Japanese fermented rice beverage) and containing no eggs, it was available in plain, strawberry, and carob flavors.</p>
<p>Also in December 1981, Redwood Valley Soyfoods Unlimited (California) introduced Soynog, the earliest known soy-based non-dairy and vegan eggnog based on soy milk and tofu (added for thickness). It was renamed Lite Nog in 1982 and Tofu Nog in 1985.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eggnog_as_a_custard">Eggnog as a custard</span></h2>
<p>Some recipes for homemade eggnog call for egg yolks to be cooked with milk into a <a href="/Custard" title="Custard">custard</a> to avoid potential hazards from raw eggs. (Some of these recipes call for any liquor used to be added beforehand, in the belief that the alcohol will evaporate during cooking.) Eggnog has much in common with classic custard-pudding recipes that do not call for cornstarch, and many types of eggnog can also be cooked into egg-custard puddings, or churned into eggnog-flavored <a href="/Ice_cream" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety_concerns">Safety concerns</span></h2>
<p>While alcohol is a <a href="/Bactericide" title="Bactericide">bactericide</a>, eggnog freshly made from eggs infected with salmonella and not heated can cause food poisoning. In 1982 most of the residents and staff of a nursing home in the U.S. became ill with salmonella poisoning, and four died. The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/nyregion/tainted-eggnog-fatal-to-4-residents-of-a-county-nursing-home-in-jersey.html" rel="nofollow">Tainted Eggnog Fatal to 4 Residents of a County Nursing Home in Jersey</a>&#34;, <i><a href="/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, 7 January 1982.&#60;/ref&#62; A later publication of the <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="Food and Drug Administration (United States)">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) stated that the alcohol in eggnog is not sufficient to sterilize contaminated eggs.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/eggnog.html" rel="nofollow">Homemade Eggnog: Make it Safely, Nancy Bufano, Food Technologist, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, FDA, 21 December 2010</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Using commercial pasteurized eggs or heating the milk-egg mixture sufficiently can make the drink safe; one recipe calls for heating the mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough to &#34;coat the back of a spoon&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eggnog_9370" rel="nofollow">BBC Food egg nog recipe</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>However, aged alcoholic eggnog becomes sterilized even if made with contaminated eggs. Aging alcoholic eggnog—sometimes for as long as a year—has been said to improve its flavor significantly, and also destroys pathogens. The <a href="/Rockefeller_University" title="Rockefeller University">Rockefeller University</a> Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology carried out an experiment in 2010 where <a href="/Salmonella" title="Salmonella">salmonella</a> was added to a strong eggnog which was refrigerated and stored; the beverage still had dangerous levels of salmonella a week later, but it was all gone within three weeks. A concentration of at least 20% of alcohol (about the same amounts of alcoholic spirits and milk or cream), and refrigeration are recommended for safety.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2013/12/20/why-aged-eggnog-made-with-raw-eggs-is-safer-than-drinking-it-fresh/" rel="nofollow">Forbes magazine: Why Aged Eggnog Made With Raw Eggs Is Safer Than Drinking It Fresh, 20 December 2013</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Borel, Brooke, <a class="external text" href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/our-modern-plagues/why-you-shouldnt-fear-eggnog" rel="nofollow">Why You Shouldn&#39;t Fear The Eggnog, 17 December  2013</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>For concerns about the safety of selling products made from raw eggs and milk, the U.S. FDA has changed or altered the definition of eggnog a number of times towards artificial replacements for the large number of eggs traditionally used. FDA regulations (as of January 2015) require eggnog to contain at least 1% egg yolk solids and at least 8.25% milk solids.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/MilkSafety/CodedMemoranda/MemorandaofInterpretation/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/MilkSafety/CodedMemoranda/MemorandaofInterpretation/default.htm</a> |title=Index of Memoranda of Interpretation (M-a) |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2009-12-25}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074481.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074481.htm</a> |title=CPG Sec. 527.350 Eggnog; Egg Nog Flavored Milk&#38;nbsp;— Common or Usual Names |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/MilkSafety/CodedMemoranda/MemorandaofInformation/ucm079112.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/MilkSafety/CodedMemoranda/MemorandaofInformation/ucm079112.htm</a> |title=M-I-03-13: Questions and Answers from FY&#39;02 Regional Milk Seminars, the Regional Milk Specialist&#39;s Conference and Special Problems in Milk Protection Courses |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2009-12-25}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=06f7f15b4a096d216e2b03517dd19cb0&#38;node=pt21.2.131&#38;rgn=div5#se21.2.131_1170" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=06f7f15b4a096d216e2b03517dd19cb0&#38;node=pt21.2.131&#38;rgn=div5#se21.2.131_1170</a> |title=U.S. Code of Federal Regulations&#38;nbsp;— Title 21 - Regulation Number: 131.170 Eggnog |publisher=<a href="/U.S._GPO" title="U.S. GPO">U.S. GPO</a> |accessdate=2015-01-03}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
