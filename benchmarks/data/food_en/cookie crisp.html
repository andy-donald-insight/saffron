<p>
The first Cookie Crisp mascot, Jarvis, was a <a href="/Wizard_(fantasy)" title="Wizard (fantasy)">wizard</a> in the <a href="/Merlin_(wizard)" title="Merlin (wizard)">Merlin</a> mold, with a wand, long robe, <a href="/Pointy_hat" title="Pointy hat">pointy hat</a>, and big white <a href="/Beard" title="Beard">beard</a>. Both the wand and the pointy hat were decorated with <a href="/Chocolate_chip_cookie" title="Chocolate chip cookie">chocolate chip cookies</a>. During his administration as Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis actually presided over three versions of Cookie Crisp: Ralston’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Crisp, Vanilla Wafer Cookie Crisp, and Oatmeal Cookie Crisp. In the commercials, with one wave of his wand, Cookie Jarvis magically turned cereal bowls into cookie jars, usually chanting rhyming incantations along with it.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cookie_Crook_and_Officer_Crumb_.281981.26amp.3Bndash.3B1997.29">Cookie Crook and Officer Crumb (1981&#38;ndash;1997)</span></h3>
<p>Eventually, Cookie Jarvis was phased out in favor of a new mascot, the Cookie Crook (1981&#38;ndash;1997). The Cookie Crook was an <a href="/Anti-hero" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a> mascot who often attempted to steal the Cookie Crisp. He had a comb mustache, and wore a red <a href="/Chef" title="Chef">chef</a>’s hat with cookies all over it. He also wore a purple shirt, and a black mask that covered his face and nose.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Cookie Crook was followed by another new character: Officer Crumb (1985&#38;ndash;1997). Officer Crumb (sometimes known simply as the Cookie Cop) was a <a href="/Police_officer" title="Police officer">police officer</a> who was always trying to thwart the Cookie Crook&#39;s attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp. He was dressed in a standard blue police uniform, and had a big nose, a thick brown mustache, and a unibrow hanging over his eyes. He spoke in an <a href="/Hiberno-English" title="Hiberno-English">Irish accent</a> and was often a diminutive character. At first, he was portrayed as a bit of a dupe who was always foiled by the Cookie Crook, but eventually it was decided that having a criminal constantly thwarting a police officer was sending the wrong message to kids.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As such, for the majority of their tenure as mascots, Officer Crumb would emerge the victor, repeatedly preventing the Crook from stealing the cereal. A typical ad would begin with the Cookie Crook attempting to steal the cereal from a live-action breakfast table; often he and Officer Crumb were portrayed as no larger than mice, so their pictures on the cereal bowl were “life size&#34;. The Crook would have some new gadget or scheme to steal the cereal, but then the Officer would arrive and save the kid’s cereal in the nick of time. Despite his heroics, Officer Crumb was a secondary character; the ever-failing Cookie Crook remained the cereal&#39;s main mascot. Eventually, the format of the ads changed to full animation, and the duo was portrayed as the size of normal humans. A more slapstick approach (similar to Looney Tunes) was used in these commercials.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chip_The_Dog_.281997.26amp.3Bndash.3B2005.29">Chip The Dog (1997&#38;ndash;2005)</span></h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, the Cookie Crook was given a sidekick named Chip The Dog. Chip would howl the cereal&#39;s name (&#34;Coo-<i>ooooooooooo</i>kie Crisp!&#34;) in each ad before he and his master were inevitably foiled by Officer Crumb. Despite starting as a sidekick, Chip soon began getting larger parts in the advertisements, until finally, in 1997, he took over as the main mascot for the cereal, and the Cookie Crook and Officer Crumb were dropped altogether.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the new format of the advertisements, Chip was a friendly pooch (no longer wearing a mask) who offered Cookie Crisp to a group of kids. Typically an adult would interfere on the grounds that cookies are not breakfast food, including Officer Crumb in one of the earliest of these advertisements, but, they would change their minds once Chip gave them a taste of his Cookie Crisp.</p>

<p>In 2005, Chip was redesigned, gaining a change in attitude and in species. He is now Chip The Wolf (originally known as The Howler), a slim gray <a href="/Wolf" title="Wolf">wolf</a> in a red sweater and blue pants. His new design seems to have come with a change back to his criminal ways&#38;mdash;the new advertisements generally depict him fruitlessly attempting to steal Cookie Crisp from children, just like the Cookie Crook, using various schemes (in these ads, he describes the cereal as well: &#34;It looks like chocolate chip cookies. Tastes like &#39;em too. But it&#39;s a breakfast cereal!&#34;). In this respect, he is much like Cereal <a href="/Mascot" title="Mascot">Mascots</a> such as the <a href="/Trix_(cereal)" title="Trix (cereal)">Trix</a> Rabbit and the children in the advertisements for <a href="/Lucky_Charms" title="Lucky Charms">Lucky Charms</a>. In this incarnation, he is voiced by <a href="/Marc_Silk" title="Marc Silk">Marc Silk</a>. In the same year, Cookie Crisp was then introduced in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>.</p>
<p>Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp was also introduced. It has the taste of peanut butter cookies.</p>
<p>In 2007, a double chocolate-flavored variety of Cookie Crisp was introduced, titled <b>Double Chocolate Cookie Crisp</b>.</p>
<p>In July 2009, <b>Cookie Crisp Sprinkles</b> were introduced. They are vanilla cookies with small sprinkles on them. The cereal is said to be <a href="/Gluten_free" title="Gluten free">gluten free</a>.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}</p>
<p>In some foreign boxes of Cookie Crisp, the mascot is a <a href="/Black_panther" title="Black panther">panther</a> who is light grey in color and wears Chip’s clothing. The panther resembles a mix between <a href="/Bagheera" title="Bagheera">Bagheera</a> and the <a href="/Pink_Panther_(character)" title="Pink Panther (character)">Pink Panther</a>. His team consists of him, the Trix Rabbit, Koko (a brown <a href="/Koala" title="Koala">koala</a>), Stars (an astronaut <a href="/Bear" title="Bear">bear</a>), and Snow (a <a href="/Polar_bear" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a>) who represent other cereals.</p>
<p>In Summer 2009, Nestlé released new packaging for the UK version of Cookie Crisp with sprinkles.</p>
<p>In 2013, <b>Cookie Crisp Brownie</b>, which has the taste of <a href="/Chocolate_brownie" title="Chocolate brownie">brownies</a>, was introduced in the U.K.</p>
