<b>Poppy milk</b> (<i>aguonų pienas</i>) is a traditional <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> drink or soup, one of the <a href="/12-dishes_Christmas_Eve_Supper" title="12-dishes Christmas Eve Supper">12-dishes Christmas Eve Supper</a> <a href="/K%C5%AB%C4%8Dios" title="Kūčios">Kūčios</a>. Usually it is eaten together with <i><a href="/K%C5%AB%C4%8Diukai" title="Kūčiukai">kūčiukai</a></i>, another traditional Lithuanian Christmas Eve dish.</p>
<p>To make poppy milk, one or two glasses of <a href="/Poppy_seed" title="Poppy seed">poppy seeds</a> are needed. The poppy seeds are soaked in some hot water for a day or so, changing the water from time to time, until the seeds become soft. Then the poppy seeds are crushed in a food processor (or with a pestle in a mortar), until a white liquid comes out. Some cold water is added (preferably water that has been boiled, and cooled), and the poppy seeds are strained and  crushed once more.  This process is repeated several times in order to get a good poppy milk concentrate. Finally, the poppy milk concentrate is diluted with some cold boiled water (the quantity of the water used, is a matter of taste, and certain family preferences, but the flavor of the poppy seeds should be pronounced). Finally, some sugar or honey is added to sweeten the poppy seed milk.</p>
