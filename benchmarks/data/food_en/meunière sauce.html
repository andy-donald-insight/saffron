&#60;/ref&#62; refers to both a sauce and a method of preparation, primarily for fish. The word itself means &#34;miller&#39;s wife&#34;. Thus to cook something <i>à la meunière</i> was to cook it by first <a href="/Dredging_(cooking)" title="Dredging (cooking)">dredging</a> it in flour. A meunière sauce is a simple preparation—brown butter, chopped parsley, and lemon—and the name refers to its unelaborate rustic nature.</p>

<p>There are two primary ways to prepare the fish (most popularly, sole or trout).  One is by <a href="/Saut%C3%A9ing" title="Sautéing">sautéing</a>—first <a href="/Dredging_(cooking)" title="Dredging (cooking)">dredging</a> the fish in seasoned flour (white flour or corn flour) and then cooking in a hot sauté pan with a small amount of <a href="/Clarified_butter" title="Clarified butter">clarified butter</a>. The alternative method is to pan-fry or deep fry the floured fish. In pan frying, oil or a combination of oil and butter is used—up to perhaps 3/4 of an inch deep. Deep frying is done in either a large fry pot or in a stand alone deep fryer. The floured fish is completely submerged in the hot oil. The frying techniques result in a crisper texture, but the sauce will need to be made separately. The sautéed fish will have a softer skin by comparison, but allows for the possibility of creating the sauce <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_la_minute">à la minute</a></i> after the fish has been removed by adding fresh butter, parsley, and lemon.</p>
<p>Meunière sauce is a variation on a brown butter sauce. While there is general agreement on the addition of parsley and lemon, some chefs have been known to include ingredients such as <a href="/Worcestershire_sauce" title="Worcestershire sauce">Worcestershire sauce</a>, red wine vinegar, or beef stock. Another common variation is to use pecans rather than almonds in an <i>amandine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trout meunière</i> and its variation <i>Trout <a href="/Amandine_(culinary_term)" title="Amandine (culinary term)">amandine</a></i> (<a href="/Speckled_seatrout" title="Speckled seatrout">speckled seatrout</a> crusted in <a href="/Almonds" title="Almonds">almonds</a>, traditionally served with a meunière sauce) are bedrock dishes of <a href="/Louisiana_Creole_cuisine" title="Louisiana Creole cuisine">New Orleans Creole cuisine</a>.
