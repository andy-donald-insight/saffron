Red-eye gravy&#39;s name comes from its distinct appearance. Prepared traditionally, with coffee and grease combined in the final step (see Preparation below), a heterogeneous mixture forms with the water-based coffee sinking to the bottom and the oil-based grease forming the top layer. In a round bowl the mixture looks much like a red human eye.&#60;ref&#62;About.com Red Eye Gravy Recipe<i><a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.recipesource.com/side-dishes/sauces/red-eye-gravy1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i>&#60;/ref&#62; Use of red pepper enhances the redness of the appearance.</p>
<p>Less traditional preparation techniques do not always result in the &#34;red eye&#34; appearance, leading to folk legends surrounding the origin of the name. For instance, one story is that former United States President <a href="/Andrew_Jackson" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> requested ham with gravy as red as his cook&#39;s eyes, which were bloodshot from drinking the night before,&#60;ref&#62;Stradley, Linda. &#34;<a class="external text" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CountryHamHistory.htm" rel="nofollow">History of Country Ham and Red-Eye Gravy</a>&#34;. <i>What&#39;s Cooking America</i>.&#60;/ref&#62; or that the black coffee in the gravy will keep people awake.&#60;ref&#62;Barrett, Elle. &#34;Good gravy&#34;. <i>Southern Living</i>, February 1999.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>After a ham has been cooked, the grease is removed from the pan. Black coffee is then used to <a href="/Deglazing_(cooking)" title="Deglazing (cooking)">deglaze</a> the pan. The coffee and grease are then poured into the same container in a one to one ratio.</p>
<p>Other recipes exist, using water instead of coffee, or adding coffee with grease still present in the pan. When the coffee is added to the grease in this manner, a homogeneous mixture may result that lacks the &#34;red eye&#34; appearance.</p>
<p><a href="/Florida_Cracker" title="Florida Cracker">Florida Crackers</a> referred to <a href="/Tomato_gravy" title="Tomato gravy">tomato gravy</a> as red-eye gravy, and prepare it in much the same way by adding flour and tomatoes to bacon grease. This is served with fried catfish or other fish.</p>
