A <b>sugar substitute</b> is a <a href="/Food_additive" title="Food additive">food additive</a> that provides a <a href="/Sweetness" title="Sweetness">sweet</a> <a href="/Taste" title="Taste">taste</a> like that of <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> while containing significantly less <a href="/Food_energy" title="Food energy">food energy</a>. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are, in general, called <b>artificial sweeteners.</b></p>
<p>An important class of sugar substitutes is known as <i>high-intensity sweeteners</i>. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of <a href="/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds (the &#34;sweetness profile&#34;) is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation.</p>
<p>If the sucrose (or other sugar) that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in <a href="/Soft_drink" title="Soft drink">soft drinks</a> or <a href="/Sweet_tea" title="Sweet tea">sweet tea</a> that are labeled as &#34;diet&#34; or &#34;light&#34; that contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different <a href="/Mouthfeel" title="Mouthfeel">mouthfeel</a>, or in table sugar replacements that mix <a href="/Maltodextrin" title="Maltodextrin">maltodextrins</a> with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.</p>
<p>In the United States, seven intensely sweet sugar substitutes have been approved for use. They are <a href="/Stevia" title="Stevia">stevia</a>, <a href="/Aspartame" title="Aspartame">aspartame</a>, <a href="/Sucralose" title="Sucralose">sucralose</a>, <a href="/Neotame" title="Neotame">neotame</a>, <a href="/Acesulfame_potassium" title="Acesulfame potassium">acesulfame potassium</a> (Ace-K), <a href="/Saccharin" title="Saccharin">saccharin</a>, and <a href="/Advantame" title="Advantame">advantame</a>. <a href="/Cyclamate" title="Cyclamate">Cyclamates</a> are used outside the U.S., but have been prohibited in the U.S. since 1969. There is some ongoing controversy over whether artificial sweetener usage poses health risks.  Others, which may or may not be approved, include Allulose (psicose), and monk fruit. The <a href="/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=High-Intensity Sweeteners |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm397716.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm397716.htm</a> |publisher=U.S. <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Food additives must be approved by the FDA, which publishes a <a href="/Generally_Recognized_as_Safe" title="Generally Recognized as Safe">Generally Recognized as Safe</a> (GRAS) list of additives.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/default.htm</a> |publisher=U.S. <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;  (Stevia is exempt under FDA&#39;s GRAS policy due to its being a natural substance in wide use well before 1958, and has been approved by FDA). The conclusions about safety are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including hundreds of toxicological and clinical studies.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/</a>|title=Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)|work=fda.gov}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The majority of sugar substitutes approved for food use are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including <a href="/Sorbitol" title="Sorbitol">sorbitol</a> and <a href="/Xylitol" title="Xylitol">xylitol</a>, which are found in <a href="/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, and <a href="/Mushroom" title="Mushroom">mushrooms</a>. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic <a href="/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, <a href="/Xylose" title="Xylose">xylose</a> is converted to xylitol, <a href="/Lactose" title="Lactose">lactose</a> to <a href="/Lactitol" title="Lactitol">lactitol</a>, and <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known but are yet to gain official approval for food use.</p>
<p>Some non-sugar sweeteners are <i><a href="/Polyol" title="Polyol">polyols</a></i>, also known as &#34;<a href="/Sugar_alcohol" title="Sugar alcohol">sugar alcohols</a>&#34;.  These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. Sometimes the sweetness profile is &#39;fine-tuned&#39; by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners. As with all food products, the development of a formulation to replace sucrose is a complex proprietary process.</p>

<p>Sugar substitutes are used instead of sugar for a number of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>To assist in <a href="/Weight_loss" title="Weight loss">weight loss</a> – some people choose to limit their food energy intake by replacing high-energy sugar or corn syrup with other sweeteners having little or no <a href="/Food_energy" title="Food energy">food energy</a>. This allows them to eat the same foods they normally would while allowing them to lose weight and avoid other problems associated with excessive caloric intake.</li>
<li><a href="/Oral_hygiene" title="Oral hygiene">Dental care</a> – Carbohydrates and sugars usually adhere to the tooth enamel, where bacteria feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the <a href="/Microflora" title="Microflora">microflora</a> of the dental plaque.  A sweetener that can actually benefit dental health is <a href="/Xylitol" title="Xylitol">xylitol</a>, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay.  Xylitol cannot be fermented by bacteria that feed on sugar, so they have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |last=C |year=2010 |title= Unique Sweetener Supports Oral health|url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.vrp.com/xylitol/xylitol-a-sweet-alternative-unique-sweetener-supports-oral-health" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrp.com/xylitol/xylitol-a-sweet-alternative-unique-sweetener-supports-oral-health</a> |publisher=vrp.com}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Diabetes_mellitus" title="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes mellitus</a> – people with diabetes have difficulty regulating their <a href="/Blood_sugar" title="Blood sugar">blood sugar</a> levels, and need to limit their sugar intake. Many artificial sweeteners allow sweet tasting food without increasing blood glucose. Others do release energy but are metabolized more slowly, preventing spikes in blood glucose.</li>
<li><a href="/Reactive_hypoglycemia" title="Reactive hypoglycemia">Reactive hypoglycemia</a> – individuals with reactive hypoglycemia will produce an excess of insulin after quickly absorbing glucose into the bloodstream. This causes their blood glucose levels to fall below the amount needed for proper body and brain function. As a result, like diabetics, they must avoid intake of <a href="/Glycemic" title="Glycemic">high-glycemic</a> foods like white bread, and often use artificial sweeteners for sweetness without blood glucose.</li>
<li>Avoiding processed foods – Some people choose to replace refined white sugar with less-processed sugars, such as fruit juice or maple syrup. (See <a href="/List_of_unrefined_sweeteners" title="List of unrefined sweeteners">List of unrefined sweeteners</a>).</li>
<li>Cost – many sugar substitutes are cheaper than sugar.  Alternative sweeteners are often lower in total cost because of their long shelf-life and high sweetening intensity. This allows alternative sweeteners to be used in products that will not perish after a short period of time.&#60;ref&#62;Coultate, T. (2009). Food: The chemistry of its components.

Mice given drinking water supplemented with artificial sweetener (commercial formulations of saccharin, sucralose or aspartame) developed greater glucose intolerance than mice drinking pure water, or water with only sugar added. The effect occurred both in mice fed standard food and those on a high-fat diet.  Changes in the composition of the gut flora were observed by sequencing a ribosomal RNA gene.  When <a href="/Antibiotics" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a> were then used to kill off gut bacteria, the degree of glucose intolerance in mice fed either diet was restored to normal levels present before artificial sweetener was introduced.  Human subjects were also studied.

The researchers noted that the increase in human consumption of artificial sweeteners coincides with the modern epidemic incidence of obesity and diabetes.  In a journal commentary, two researchers of the pathology department at the University of Chicago, who were not involved in the study, opined that this combination of data indicates that artificial sweeteners &#34;may contribute to, rather than alleviate, obesity-related metabolic conditions, by altering the composition and function of bacterial populations in the gut&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|author=Taylor Feehley and Cathryn R.

{{See also|Aspartame controversy}}
Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the <a href="/G.D._Searle" title="G.D. Searle">G.D. Searle</a> company (later purchased by Monsanto). He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed that it had a sweet taste. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids <a href="/Aspartic_acid" title="Aspartic acid">aspartic acid</a> and <a href="/Phenylalanine" title="Phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and can be used as a tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, <a href="/Beverage" title="Beverage">beverages</a>, and <a href="/Chewing_gum" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>.  When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids.  This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks.  Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original <a href="/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>.  Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.</p>

<p>{{Main|Saccharin}}
Aside from <a href="/Sugar_of_lead" title="Sugar of lead">sugar of lead</a>, <a href="/Saccharin" title="Saccharin">saccharin</a> was the first artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process for the creation of saccharin from <a href="/Phthalic_anhydride" title="Phthalic anhydride">phthalic anhydride</a> was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times as sweet as sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.</p>
<p>Fear about saccharin increased when a 1960 study showed that high levels of saccharin may cause <a href="/Bladder_cancer" title="Bladder cancer">bladder cancer</a> in laboratory rats. In 1977, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> banned saccharin due to the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning saccharin in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a warning label and also mandated further study of saccharin safety.</p>
<p>Subsequent to this, it was discovered that saccharin causes cancer in male rats by a mechanism not found in humans. At high doses, saccharin causes a precipitate to form in rat urine. This precipitate damages the cells lining the bladder (urinary bladder urothelial cytotoxicity) and a <a href="/Tumor" title="Tumor">tumor</a> forms when the cells regenerate (regenerative hyperplasia). According to the <a href="/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer" title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a>, part of the <a href="/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>, &#34;Saccharin and its salts was (sic) downgraded from Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans, to Group 3, not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans, despite sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity to animals, because it is carcinogenic by a non-DNA-reactive mechanism that is not relevant to humans because of critical interspecies differences in urine composition.&#34;</p>
<p>In 2001 the United States repealed the warning label requirement, while the threat of an FDA ban had already been lifted in 1991. Most other countries also permit saccharin but restrict the levels of use, while other countries have outright banned it.</p>
<p>The EPA has officially removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010, release the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.</p>

<p>{{Main|Acesulfame potassium}}
<a href="/Acesulfame_potassium" title="Acesulfame potassium">Acesulfame potassium</a> is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (common sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about two thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame&#39;s aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other&#39;s aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.</p>
<p>Unlike aspartame, acesulfame potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, allowing it to be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.</p>
