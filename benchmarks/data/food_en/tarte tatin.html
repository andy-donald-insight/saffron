<p>Research shows that the tarte Tatin was created accidentally at the Hotel Tatin in <a href="/Lamotte-Beuvron" title="Lamotte-Beuvron">Lamotte-Beuvron</a>, France, about 100 miles (160&#38;nbsp;km) south of Paris, in the 1880s.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Delétang|first=Henri|title=La tarte Tatin - Histoire et légendes|year=2011|publisher=Editions Alan Sutton|location=France|isbn=2-8138-0431-2|page=128|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.amazon.fr/tarte-Tatin-Histoire-l%C3%A9gendes/dp/2813804312/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1325154826&#38;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.fr/tarte-Tatin-Histoire-l%C3%A9gendes/dp/2813804312/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1325154826&#38;sr=1-1</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The hotel was run by two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline Tatin.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|title=La tarte Tatin son histoire et ses légendes|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/LOISIRS/Livres-cd-dvd/La-tarte-Tatin-son-histoire-et-ses-legendes" rel="nofollow">http://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/LOISIRS/Livres-cd-dvd/La-tarte-Tatin-son-histoire-et-ses-legendes</a>|accessdate=2011-12-29|newspaper=La Nouvelle République|date=2011-12-23}}&#60;/ref&#62; There are conflicting stories concerning the tart&#39;s origin, but the most common is that Stéphanie Tatin, who did most of the cooking, was overworked one day. She started to make a traditional <a href="/Apple_pie" title="Apple pie">apple pie</a> but left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. Smelling the burning, she tried to rescue the dish by putting the pastry base on top of the pan of apples, quickly finishing the cooking by putting the whole pan in the oven. After turning out the upside down tart, she was surprised to find how much the hotel guests appreciated the dessert. In an alternative version of the tart&#39;s origin, Stéphanie baked a caramelized apple tart upside-down by mistake, regardless she served her guests the unusual dish. &#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021121201746/http://www.tarte-tatin.com/" rel="nofollow">Tarte Tatin – Le Site Officiel de la Tarte Tatin&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62; However, whatever the veracity of this story, the concept of the &#34;upside down tarts&#34; was not a new one. For instance, patissier M. A. Carême  already mentions glazed <i>gâteaux renversés</i> adorned with apples from Rouen or other fruit in his &#34;Pâtissier Royal Parisien&#34; (1841).</p>
<p>The tarte became a <a href="/Signature_dish" title="Signature dish">signature dish</a> of the Hôtel Tatin. Historians and gourmets have argued, whether it is a genuine creation of the Demoiselles (sisters) Tatin, or the branding of an improved version of the &#34;tarte solognote&#34;, a traditional dish named after the Sologne region which surrounds Lamotte-Beuvron.  Research suggests that, while the tarte became a specialty of the Hôtel Tatin, the sisters did not set out to create a &#34;signature dish&#34;; they never wrote a cookbook or published their recipe; they never even called it <i>tarte Tatin</i>.  That recognition was bestowed upon them by <a href="/Curnonsky" title="Curnonsky">Curnonsky</a>, the famous French author and epicure, as well as the Parisian restaurant Maxim&#39;s after the sisters&#39; deaths.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|last=Delétang|first=Henri|title=Histoire et gastronomie : Les TATIN à Lamotte-Beuvron|journal=Bulletin du Groupe de Recherches Archéologiques et Historiques de Sologne|date=July–December 2000|volume=22|issue=3-4|page=112|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.grahs.1901.org/spip.php?article114" rel="nofollow">http://www.grahs.1901.org/spip.php?article114</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>One of the legends has it that Louis Vaudable, the owner of Maxim&#39;s, once tasted it and was smitten.  As he <a class="external text" href="http://www.tartetatin.org/home/history-of-the-tarte-tatin" rel="nofollow">described</a> it:</p>
<p>&#34;I used to hunt around Lamotte-Beuvron in my youth and had discovered, in a very small hotel run by elderly ladies, a marvelous dessert listed on the menu under tarte solognote; I questioned the kitchen staff about its recipe, but was sternly rebuffed.  Undaunted, I got myself hired as a gardener, but three days later, I was fired when it became clear that I could hardly plant a cabbage; however this was long enough to pierce the secrets of the kitchen; I brought the recipe back and put it on my own menu under &#39;tarte des demoiselles Tatin&#39;.&#34;</p>
<p>In reality, Mr. Vaudable was born in 1902; the sisters retired in 1906 and died in 1911 and 1917; whereas Maxim&#39;s was purchased by the Vaudable family in 1932.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ingredients">Ingredients</span></h2>

<p>Originally, the tarte Tatin was made with two regional apple varieties: Reine des Reinettes (King of the Pippins), and Calville.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Tarte Tatin|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.tartetatin.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tartetatin.org/</a>|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; Over the years, other varieties have tended to displace them, including <a href="/Golden_Delicious" title="Golden Delicious">Golden Delicious</a>, <a href="/Granny_Smith" title="Granny Smith">Granny Smith</a>, and <a href="/Gala_(apple)" title="Gala (apple)">Gala</a>. When choosing apples for a tarte Tatin, it is important to pick some that will hold their shape while cooking, and not melt into apple sauce. In North America, <a href="/Golden_Delicious" title="Golden Delicious">Golden Delicious</a>, <a href="/Granny_Smith" title="Granny Smith">Granny Smith</a>, or Jonathan are excellent choices.</p>
<p>Tarte Tatin can also be made with pears, <a href="/Peach" title="Peach">peaches</a>, <a href="/Pineapple" title="Pineapple">pineapple</a>, tomatoes,&#60;ref&#62;Melissa Clark. <a class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/dining/17appe.html" rel="nofollow">&#34;A Tart That’s Sweet, Yet Savory&#34;</a>. <i>The New York Times</i>, 12 September 2008.&#60;/ref&#62; other fruit, or vegetables, such as onion.</p>
<p>In terms of dough the tarte Tatin can be made with both puff pastry or shortcrust pastry.</p>
