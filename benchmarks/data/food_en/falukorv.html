<p><b>Falukorv</b> is a Swedish <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> (<i>korv</i> in Swedish) made of a grated mixture of smoked pork and beef or veal with <a href="/Potato_starch_flour" title="Potato starch flour">potato starch flour</a>, onion, salt and mild spices. Falukorv is a cooked sausage, so it can be eaten without any further preparation. Some Swedes use it as a sandwich ingredient, much like <a href="/Ham" title="Ham">ham</a> or <a href="/Turkey_meat" title="Turkey meat">turkey</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The history of Falukorv reaches back to the <a href="/Great_Copper_Mountain" title="Great Copper Mountain">Falun copper mine</a> during the 16th and 17th century, where ox hide was used for ropes and some of the meat remaining after slaughter was salted and smoked and used for sausages.  The sausage was based on the <a href="/Bologna_sausage" title="Bologna sausage">Lyoner</a> sausage; the recipe, in which the meat is smoked and salted, was probably brought to the region by Germans working in the mine. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}</p>
<p>The tradition of preparing the meat in this way was revitalised in the late 19th century by the butcher Anders Olsson, whose initiative led to the development of the modern Falukorv, which uses a mixture of pork and beef or veal. A popular sausage, Falukorv has <a href="/Protected_designation_of_origin" title="Protected designation of origin">TSG</a> status. According to <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a> guidelines, restrictions apply to what may be labeled &#34;Falukorv&#34; since 2001.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=303" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=303</a>|title=Falukorv|work=<a href="/DOOR_(Database_of_Origin_and_Registration)" title="DOOR (Database of Origin and Registration)">DOOR</a>|publisher=<a href="/Europa_(web_portal)" title="Europa (web portal)">Europa</a>|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62; Only potato flour may be used as a <a href="/Binder_(material)" title="Binder (material)">binding agent</a>, and the amount of meat may not fall short of 40%.</p>
