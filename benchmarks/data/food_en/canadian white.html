<p><b>Canadian white bread</b> is a style of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> produced by several bread companies including <a href="/Pepperidge_Farm" title="Pepperidge Farm">Pepperidge Farm</a>, <a href="/Trader_Joes" title="Trader Joes">Trader Joes</a>, and J.J. Nissen. It has a thicker consistency than the regular <a href="/White_bread" title="White bread">white bread</a> familiar in the United States. J.J. Nissen also offers other <a href="/Canadian" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> style breads. The term <i>Canadian white bread</i> is not used at all in Canada; similar to usage of the term <i>Canadian bacon</i>, Canadian white is referred to as &#34;white bread&#34; in Canada, and only called &#34;Canadian white bread&#34; when it is exported.</p>
