The availability of black powder (<a href="/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>) to propel projectiles was a precursor to experiments as weapons such as <a href="/Bomb" title="Bomb">bombs</a>, <a href="/Cannon" title="Cannon">cannon</a>, incendiary <a href="/Fire_arrow" title="Fire arrow">fire arrows</a> and rocket-propelled fire arrows.{{#tag:ref|&#34;With its ninth century AD origins in China, the knowledge of gunpowder emerged from the search by alchemists for the secrets of life, to filter through the channels of Middle Eastern culture, and take root in Europe with consequences that form the context of the studies in this volume.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{Harvnb|Buchanan|2006|p=2}}&#60;/ref&#62;|group=nb}}{{#tag:ref|&#34;Without doubt it was in the previous century, around +850, that the early alchemical experiments on the constituents of gunpowder, with its self-contained oxygen, reached their climax in the appearance of the mixture itself.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{Harvnb|Needham|1986|p=7}}&#60;/ref&#62;|group=nb}} The discovery of gunpowder was probably the product of centuries of <a href="/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">alchemical</a> experimentation in which <a href="/Taoist" title="Taoist">Taoist</a> alchemists were trying to create an elixir of immortality that would allow the person ingesting it to become physically immortal.&#60;ref name=chase&#62;{{Harvnb|Chase|2003|pp=31–32}}&#60;/ref&#62; However, anyone with a wood fire might have observed the acceleration of combustion that accidentally-chosen <a href="/Niter" title="Niter">saltpetre-containing</a> rocks would have produced.</p>
<p>Exactly when the first <a href="/Flight" title="Flight">flights</a> of rockets occurred is contested.
Merely lighting a centimeter-sized solid lump of gunpowder on one side can cause it to move via reaction (even without a nozzle for efficiency), so confinement in a tube and other design refinements may easily have followed for the experimentally-minded with ready access to saltpetre.</p>
<p>A problem for dating the first rocket flight is that Chinese <i>fire arrows</i> can be either arrows with explosives attached, or arrows propelled by gunpowder. There were reports of fire arrows and &#39;iron pots&#39; that could be heard for 5 <a href="/League_(unit)" title="League (unit)">leagues</a> (25&#38;nbsp;km, or 15 miles) when they exploded, causing devastation for a radius of 600 meters (2,000 feet), apparently due to shrapnel.&#60;ref name=&#34;nasa&#34;/&#62; A common claim is that the first recorded use of a rocket in battle was by the Chinese in 1232 against the <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> hordes at <a href="/Kaifeng" title="Kaifeng">Kai Feng Fu</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Martin&#34;&#62;This is based on an old Mandarin civil service examination question that reads &#34;Is the defense of Kai Feng Fu against the Mongols (1232) the first recorded use of cannon?&#34;.Another question from the examinations read &#34;Fire-arms began with the use of rockets in the dynasty of Chou (B.

The British then took an active interest in the technology and developed it further during the 19th century. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than the British had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&#38;nbsp;km range).

<a href="/William_Congreve_(inventor)" title="William Congreve (inventor)">William Congreve</a>, son of the Comptroller of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, London, became a major figure in the field.

This early <a href="/Congreve_rocket" title="Congreve rocket">Congreve rocket</a> weighed about 32 pounds (14.5 kilograms). The Royal Arsenal&#39;s first demonstration of solid fuel rockets was in 1805. The rockets were effectively used during the <a href="/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> and the <a href="/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>.

The early <a href="/Mysorean_rockets" title="Mysorean rockets">Mysorean rockets</a> and their successor British <a href="/Congreve_rocket" title="Congreve rocket">Congreve rockets</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;congreve&#34;/&#62; reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick to the end of a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to make it harder for the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5&#38;nbsp;kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.</p>
<p>The accuracy problem was greatly improved in 1844 when <a href="/William_Hale_(British_inventor)" title="William Hale (British inventor)">William Hale</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;SMITH&#34;&#62;{{harvnb|Space History Division|1999}}&#60;/ref&#62; modified the rocket design so that thrust was slightly <a href="/Thrust_vectoring" title="Thrust vectoring">vectored</a>, causing the rocket to spin along its axis of travel like a bullet. The Hale rocket removed the need for a rocket stick, travelled further due to reduced air resistance, and was far more accurate.</p>

In 1912 <a href="/Robert_Goddard_(scientist)" title="Robert Goddard (scientist)">Robert Goddard</a>, inspired from an early age by H.G. Wells, began a serious analysis of rockets, concluding that conventional solid-fuel rockets needed to be improved in three ways.
First, fuel should be burned in a small combustion chamber, instead of building the entire propellant container to withstand the high pressures. Second, rockets could be arranged in stages. Finally, the exhaust speed (and thus the efficiency) could be greatly increased to beyond the speed of sound by using a <a href="/De_Laval_nozzle" title="De Laval nozzle">De Laval nozzle</a>.

Thousands were fired at various <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> nations, mainly Belgium, as well as England and France. While they could not be intercepted, their guidance system design and single conventional warhead meant that it was insufficiently accurate against military targets. A total of 2,754 people in England were killed, and 6,523 were wounded before the launch campaign was ended. There were also 20,000 deaths of slave labour during the construction of V-2s.

<p>
In a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along.</p>
<p>The shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is <i>pulled</i> by it.&#60;ref&#62;J W Warren,Understanding Force 1979, London pg 28&#60;/ref&#62; Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains.&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE7&#34;/&#62; Note that the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber -typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.</p>
<p>As a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to <a href="/Newton&#39;s_Third_Law" title="Newton&#39;s Third Law">Newton&#39;s Third Law</a>).&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE7&#34;/&#62; From the principle of <a href="/Conservation_of_momentum" title="Conservation of momentum">conservation of momentum</a> the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket&#39;s <i><a href="/Specific_impulse" title="Specific impulse">specific impulse</a></i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE7&#34;/&#62; Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body&#39;s mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.</p>

<p>{{For|a more detailed model of the net thrust of a rocket engine that includes the effect of atmospheric pressure|Rocket_engine#Net_thrust}}
A typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the <a href="/Thrust-to-weight_ratio" title="Thrust-to-weight ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a> of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 for some of the better&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.geae.com/engines/military/j85/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geae.com/engines/military/j85/index.html</a> |title=General Electric J85 |publisher=Geae.com |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&#60;/ref&#62; engines.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Club/Secure/Arfons_Last_Stand.html" rel="nofollow">ThrustSSC Mach 1 Club: ART ARFONS LAST STAND by Richard Noble</a> J-85 has &#34;5.6 lbs of thrust for each pound of engine&#34;&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>It can be shown that the net thrust of a rocket is:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;F_n = \dot{m}\;v_{e}&#60;/math&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Harvnb|Sutton|2001}} eq-2-14&#60;/ref&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>where:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62; \dot{m} =\,&#60;/math&#62;propellant flow (kg/s or lb/s)</dd>
</dl>


<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;v_{e} =\,&#60;/math&#62;the <a href="/Effective_exhaust_velocity" title="Effective exhaust velocity">effective exhaust velocity</a> (m/s or ft/s)</dd>
</dl>

<p>The effective exhaust velocity &#60;math&#62;v_{e}&#60;/math&#62; is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.</p>
<p>The rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses&#60;ref name=maxq/&#62; and can limit the increase of <a href="/G-force" title="G-force"><i>g</i>-forces</a> due to the reduction in propellant load.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Total_impulse">Total impulse</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Impulse (physics)}}
Impulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the <a href="/Momentum" title="Momentum">momentum</a> (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or &#34;power&#34;. The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:&#60;ref&#62;{{Harvnb|Sutton|2001|p=27}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;I = \int F dt&#60;/math&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>When there is fixed thrust, this is simply:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;I = F t\;&#60;/math&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>The total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages.
{{Clear}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specific_impulse">Specific impulse</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|specific impulse}}
{{Specific impulse|align=right}}
As can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.</p>
<p>An equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called <a href="/Specific_impulse" title="Specific impulse">specific Impulse</a>, &#60;math&#62;I_{sp}&#60;/math&#62;, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket&#39;s performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;v_e = I_{sp} \cdot g_0&#60;/math&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Harvnb|Sutton|2001|p=29}}&#60;/ref&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>where:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;I_{sp}&#60;/math&#62; has units of seconds</dd>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;g_0&#60;/math&#62; is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth</dd>
</dl>

<p>Thus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine. &#60;math&#62;I_{sp}&#60;/math&#62; is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500&#38;nbsp;m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.</p>

Almost all of a launch vehicle&#39;s mass consists of propellant.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm</a> |title=The Evolution of Rockets |publisher=Istp.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&#60;/ref&#62; Mass ratio is, for any &#39;burn&#39;, the ratio between the rocket&#39;s initial mass and the mass after.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktwtp.html" rel="nofollow">http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktwtp.html</a> |title=Rocket Mass Ratios |publisher=Exploration.grc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&#60;/ref&#62; Everything else being equal, a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance, since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better, for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars.</p>
<p>Rockets as a group have the highest <a href="/Thrust-to-weight_ratio" title="Thrust-to-weight ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a> of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high <a href="/Mass_ratio" title="Mass ratio">mass ratios</a>, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g.&#60;ref name=soyuzt/&#62;</p>
<p>Achievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.</p>
<p>The highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for <a href="/Orbital_launch_vehicle" title="Orbital launch vehicle">orbital launch vehicles</a>, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of <a href="/Liquid_hydrogen" title="Liquid hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> and <a href="/Liquid_methane_rocket_fuel" title="Liquid methane rocket fuel">liquid methane</a>), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance <a href="/Turbopumps" title="Turbopumps">turbopumps</a> to force the propellant into the combustion chamber.</p>

{{Main|Multistage rocket}}
Often, the required velocity (delta-v) for a mission is unattainable by any single rocket because the <a href="/Propellant" title="Propellant">propellant</a>, tankage, structure, <a href="/Guidance_system" title="Guidance system">guidance</a>, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v.</p>
<p>For example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a <a href="/Mass_ratio" title="Mass ratio">mass ratio</a> of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9&#38;nbsp;km/s whereas around 9.4&#38;nbsp;km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.</p>
<p>This problem is frequently solved by <a href="/Staging_(rocketry)" title="Staging (rocketry)">staging</a>&#38;nbsp;— the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either <i>serial</i> where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or <i>parallel</i>, where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.&#60;ref name=&#34;NASAstaging&#34;&#62;{{harvnb|NASA|2006}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acceleration_and_thrust-to-weight_ratio">Acceleration and thrust-to-weight ratio</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|thrust-to-weight ratio}}
From Newton&#39;s second law, the acceleration, &#60;math&#62;a&#60;/math&#62;, of a vehicle is simply:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;a = \frac {F_n} {m}&#60;/math&#62;</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and &#60;math&#62;F_n&#60;/math&#62; is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust but air drag and other forces can play a part.)</p>
<p>As the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter.&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE7&#34;/&#62; However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.</p>
<p>Peak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.</p>
<p>The minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the <a href="/Thrust-to-weight_ratio" title="Thrust-to-weight ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a>{{#tag:ref|“thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&#60;sub&#62;g&#60;/sub&#62; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g&#60;sub&#62;0&#60;/sub&#62;) ... in a gravity-free vacuum”&#60;ref name=&#34;suttontw&#34;&#62;{{Harvnb|Sutton|2001|p=442}}&#60;/ref&#62;|group=nb}} of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the <a href="/NK-33" title="NK-33">NK-33</a> engine,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm</a> |title=Astronautix NK-33 entry |publisher=Astronautix.com |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&#60;/ref&#62; some solid rockets are over 1000&#60;ref name=&#34;suttontw&#34;/&#62;), and nearly all really <a href="/G-force" title="G-force">high-g</a> vehicles employ or have employed rockets.</p>
<p>The high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of <a href="/VTOL" title="VTOL">vertical takeoff</a>; this can be done provided a vehicle&#39;s engines provide more than the local gravitational acceleration.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Drag">Drag</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Drag (physics)|Gravity drag|Aerodynamic drag}}
Drag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket&#39;s motion. This decreases acceleration of the vehicle and produces structural loads. Deceleration force for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the <a href="/Drag_equation" title="Drag equation">drag equation</a>.</p>
<p>Drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic <a href="/Nose_cone" title="Nose cone">nose cone</a> and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the &#34;classic&#34; rocket shape—long and thin), and by keeping the rocket&#39;s <a href="/Angle_of_attack" title="Angle of attack">angle of attack</a> as low as possible.</p>
<p>During a rocket launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called <a href="/Max_Q" title="Max Q">Max Q</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy">Energy</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_efficiency">Energy efficiency</span></h4>
<p>{{Main|propulsive efficiency}}
Rocket launch vehicles take-off with a great deal of flames, noise and drama, and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.</p>
<p>The energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as <a href="/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic</a> or <a href="/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">potential energy</a> of the body of the rocket as possible.</p>
<p>Energy from the fuel is lost in air drag and <a href="/Gravity_drag" title="Gravity drag">gravity drag</a> and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>In a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE&#34;&#62;{{Harvnb|Sutton|2001|pp=37–38}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;\eta_c= \frac {\frac {1} {2}\dot{m}v_e^2} {\eta_{combustion} P_{chem} }&#60;/math&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency &#60;math&#62;\eta_c = 100\%&#60;/math&#62;) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. <a href="/Heat_Engine#Efficiency" title="Heat Engine">This is not possible</a>, but the near-adiabatic <a href="/Rocket_engine_nozzle" title="Rocket engine nozzle">high expansion ratio nozzles</a> that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered.&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE&#34;/&#62; The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good <a href="/Carnot_efficiency" title="Carnot efficiency">Carnot efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>However, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other <a href="/Jet_engine" title="Jet engine">jet-based engines</a>, but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of <a href="/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> rearward. This phenomenon is termed <a href="/Propulsive_efficiency" title="Propulsive efficiency">propulsive efficiency</a> (&#60;math&#62;\eta_p&#60;/math&#62;).&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>However, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up travelling forwards- trailing behind the vehicle.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a class="internal" href="/File:Average_propulsive_efficiency_of_rockets.png" title="Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency"><img src="/Average_propulsive_efficiency_of_rockets.png" alt="Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency" title="Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency" class="type-thumb" width="220" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency</div></div>
</div>

<p>From these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency &#60;math&#62;\eta_p&#60;/math&#62; for a rocket moving at speed &#60;math&#62;u&#60;/math&#62; with an exhaust velocity &#60;math&#62;c&#60;/math&#62; is:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;\eta_p= \frac {2 \frac {u} {c}} {1 + ( \frac {u} {c} )^2 }&#60;/math&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;RPE&#34;/&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>And the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency &#60;math&#62;\eta&#60;/math&#62; is:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;\eta= \eta_p \eta_c&#60;/math&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, from the equation, with an &#60;math&#62;\eta_c&#60;/math&#62; of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation.</p>
<p>Since the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as <a href="/ICBM" title="ICBM">ICBMs</a> or <a href="/Orbital_spaceflight" title="Orbital spaceflight">orbital launch</a>. For example, <a href="/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>&#39;s <a href="/Space_shuttle" title="Space shuttle">space shuttle</a> fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000&#38;nbsp;tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000&#38;nbsp;litres of liquid propellant (106,261&#38;nbsp;kg of <a href="/Liquid_hydrogen" title="Liquid hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> fuel) to lift the 100,000&#38;nbsp;kg vehicle (including the 25,000&#38;nbsp;kg payload) to an altitude of 111&#38;nbsp;km and an orbital <a href="/Velocity" title="Velocity">velocity</a> of 30,000&#38;nbsp;km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3&#38;nbsp;TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200&#38;nbsp;GJ. Given the initial energy of 20&#38;nbsp;TJ,{{#tag:ref|The energy density is 31MJ per kg for aluminum and 143&#38;nbsp;MJ/kg for liquid hydrogen, this means that the vehicle consumes around 5&#38;nbsp;TJ of solid propellant and 15&#38;nbsp;TJ of hydrogen fuel.|group=nb}} the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.</p>
<p>Thus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as <a href="/Turbofans" title="Turbofans">turbofans</a>—in spite of their worse &#60;math&#62;\eta_c&#60;/math&#62;)—dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range <i>relatively</i> low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Oberth_effect">Oberth effect</span></h4>
<p>{{Main|Oberth effect}}
One subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular <a href="/Delta-v" title="Delta-v">delta-v</a>. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because <a href="/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more <a href="/Orbital_energy" title="Orbital energy">orbital energy</a> it gains or loses.</p>
<p>This fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.</p>
