<p>Crêpes are especially popular throughout France. The common ingredients include flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a pinch of salt. Crêpes are usually of two types: <i>sweet crêpes</i> (<i>crêpes sucrées</i>) made with wheat flour and slightly sweetened; and <i>savoury <a href="/Galette" title="Galette">galettes</a></i> (<i>crêpes salées</i>) made with <a href="/Buckwheat" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a> flour and unsweetened. The name &#34;galette&#34; came from the French word <i>galet</i> (&#34;pebble&#34;), since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire. Batter made from buckwheat flour is <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or <a href="/Food_intolerance" title="Food intolerance">intolerance</a> to eat this type of crêpe.  <i>Mille crêpes</i> is a <a href="/Cuisine_of_France" title="Cuisine of France">French</a> cake made of many crêpe layers. The word <i>mille</i> means &#34;a thousand&#34;, implying the many layers of crêpe.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news| url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/15FOOD.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/15FOOD.html</a> | work=The New York Times | title=The Way We Eat: Building a Modern, Multistoried Dessert | first=Amanda | last=Hesser | date=15 May 2005}}&#60;/ref&#62; Another standard French and <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> crêpe is the <i><a href="/Cr%C3%AApe_Suzette" title="Crêpe Suzette">crêpe Suzette</a></i>, a crêpe with lightly grated orange peel and <a href="/Liqueur" title="Liqueur">liqueur</a> (usually <a href="/Grand_Marnier" title="Grand Marnier">Grand Marnier</a>) which is subsequently lit upon presentation.&#60;ref&#62;Courtine, Robert J.

<p><b><a href="/Swedish_pancake" title="Swedish pancake">Swedish pancakes</a></b>, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to the French crêpes. In some of the Nordic countries they are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savory fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor, which resembles the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine has plättar which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter (fläskpannkaka); these are baked in the oven. Potato pancakes called raggmunk contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing rårakor). Raggmunk and rårakor are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is saffron pancake from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special &#34;Swedish pancake&#34; is the äggakaka (eggcake), also called skånsk äggakaka (scanian eggcake), it is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1½ to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry jam) or sugar.</p>

<p>
The &#39;49er flapjack&#39; is a <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a> crepe which is popular in the United States,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the <a href="/Gold_rush" title="Gold rush">gold rush</a>. During the <a href="/Klondike_gold_rush" title="Klondike gold rush">Klondike gold rush</a> of 1898, it was said that a real &#34;Alaskan Sourdough&#34; would just as soon spend a year in the hills without his rifle, as to tough it through without his bubbling sourdough pot. Since food was scarce, food provisions were more valuable than gold. In extreme cold, miners would put the dough ball under their clothes, next to their skin, or tuck it into their bedroll with them at night, anything to keep the yeast in it alive. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake the 49er is sometimes served with <a href="/Lingonberry" title="Lingonberry">lingonberry</a> sauce, although most often it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar, or served open faced and topped with maple syrup.</p>

<p>In France, crêpes are traditionally served on <a href="/Candlemas" title="Candlemas">Candlemas</a> (<i>La Chandeleur</i>), 2 February. This day was originally Virgin Mary&#39;s Blessing Day, but became known in France as &#34;Le Jour des Crêpes&#34; (literally translated &#34;The Day of the Crêpes&#34;, but sometimes given colloquially as &#34;Avec Crêpe Day&#34; or &#34;National Crêpe Day&#34;), referring to the tradition of offering crêpes. The belief was that if you could catch the crêpe with a <a href="/Frying_pan" title="Frying pan">frying pan</a> after tossing it in the air with your right hand and holding a gold coin in your left hand, you would become rich that year.&#60;ref&#62;

This symbolism also applies to the coin held in the person&#39;s hand. &#60;ref&#62;Sokolov, Raymond. &#34;Sun food.&#34; Natural History May 1993: 82. Academic Search Complete. &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
