Quisp and the similarly marketed cereal Quake were originally released in 1965 in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> by the <a href="/Quaker_Oats_Company" title="Quaker Oats Company">Quaker Oats Company</a> and generally advertised together (during the same commercial) with their character mascots competing against each other. The ads were <a href="/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoons</a> created by <a href="/Jay_Ward" title="Jay Ward">Jay Ward</a>, who also created the cartoon characters <a href="/Rocky_and_Bullwinkle" title="Rocky and Bullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a>, <a href="/Dudley_Do-Right" title="Dudley Do-Right">Dudley Do-Right</a>, and many others, and the Quisp ads used some of the same voice actors as the <i><a href="/Rocky_and_Bullwinkle" title="Rocky and Bullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></i> series, including <a href="/Daws_Butler" title="Daws Butler">Daws Butler</a> as the voice of Quisp (an <a href="/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien</a>) and <a href="/William_Conrad" title="William Conrad">William Conrad</a> as the voice of Quake (a <a href="/Miner" title="Miner">miner</a>). In an interview, Ward&#39;s creative partner Bill Scott described Ward&#39;s involvement in cereal advertising: &#34;When the cereal company approached Jay about doing this stuff — I think it was in 1961 — he said, &#39;We’ll only do it as long as it’s fun.&#39;&#34;&#60;ref&#62;Scott, in {{cite news | url = <a class="external free" href="http://cartoonician.com/bullwinkle-speaks-an-interview-with-bill-scott/" rel="nofollow">http://cartoonician.com/bullwinkle-speaks-an-interview-with-bill-scott/</a> | title=Bullwinkle Speaks!

<p>The commercials often asked children to choose which cereal was better, and to compete over taste or premiums. The competition reached its peak in 1972, when a series of commercials asked children to vote for which cereal should remain on the shelves. Quake had a makeover in 1969, slimming down and changing his miner hat for an Australian bush hat and Australian accent,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite video|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E70QI7m5uqI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E70QI7m5uqI</a>|title=Vintage Quisp &#38; Quake cereal commercial  |accessdate= November 8, 2012|publisher=YouTube|date=November 29, 2009}}&#60;/ref&#62; but that was not enough. Quisp was the winner and Quake was discontinued. The character Quake, however, reappeared as a sidekick of an orange kangaroo named Simon in an orange-flavored cereal called Quangaroos. In 1976, Quaker Oats ran another contest, this time asking children to choose between Quisp and Quangaroos. Quisp won again and Quangaroos was discontinued.&#60;ref name=&#34;mrbf&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Quisp was discontinued due to low sales.&#60;ref name=&#34;mrbf&#34; /&#62; It was brought back in the mid-1980s, then again in the 1990s and in 2001, where it was relaunched as the &#34;first <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> cereal&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;mrbf&#34; /&#62; Consumers were encouraged to visit the Quisp <a href="/Web_site" title="Web site">Web site</a> to view animated endings to cartoons on the back of the cereal box.

<p>Quisp has remained in limited distribution, with Quaker Oats distributing the product in &#34;guerrilla displays&#34; that would appear in a store and last until the product sold out.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Even in the late 2000s, it could occasionally be found in grocery and discount chains such as <a href="/Dollar_General" title="Dollar General">Dollar General</a>, <a href="/Marc&#39;s" title="Marc&#39;s">Marc&#39;s</a>, <a href="/Target_Corporation#SuperTarget" title="Target Corporation">SuperTarget</a>, and <a href="/Food_Lion" title="Food Lion">Food Lion</a>.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Quaker Oats also sells Quisp directly to the public through an online store.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://quakeroats.elsstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://quakeroats.elsstore.com/</a>|title=Quaker Oats Online Store|accessdate= November 8, 2012|publisher=Quaker Oats Company|year=2010}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
