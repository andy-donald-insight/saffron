<p>Sugarcane is a tropical,  perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems, typically three to four metres high and about five cm in diameter. The stems grow into cane stalk, which when mature constitutes approximately 75% of the entire plant. A mature stalk is typically composed of 11–16% fiber, 12–16% soluble sugars, 2–3% non-sugars, and 63–73% water. A sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate, soil type, irrigation, fertilizers, insects, disease control, varieties, and the harvest period. The average yield of cane stalk is 60–70 tonnes per hectare per year. However, this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane is a <a href="/Cash_crop" title="Cash crop">cash crop</a>, but it is also used as livestock fodder.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Feeding pigs in the tropics|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|author=Rena Perez|year= 1997 | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3647e/W3647E00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3647e/W3647E00.htm</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Early farmers in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, may have also boiled the cane juice down to a viscous mass to facilitate transportation,  but the earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India.  The exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear.  The earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts.&#60;ref&#62;See:

Sugar (often in the form of molasses) was shipped from the Caribbean to Europe or New England, where it was used to make rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe.</p>
<p><a href="/France" title="France">France</a> found its sugarcane islands so valuable that it effectively traded its <a href="/New_France" title="New France">portion of Canada</a>, famously dubbed &#34;<a href="/A_few_acres_of_snow" title="A few acres of snow">a few acres of snow</a>&#34;, to Britain for their return of <a href="/Guadeloupe" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="/Martinique" title="Martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="/Saint_Lucia" title="Saint Lucia">St. Lucia</a> at the end of the <a href="/Seven_Years&#39;_War" title="Seven Years&#39; War">Seven Years&#39; War</a>.

<p><a href="/Boiling_house" title="Boiling house">Boiling houses</a> in the 17th through 19th centuries converted sugarcane juice into raw <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. These houses were attached to sugar plantations in the Western colonies. Slaves often ran the boiling process under very poor conditions. Rectangular boxes of brick or stone served as furnaces, with an opening at the bottom to stoke the fire and remove ashes. At the top of each furnace were up to seven copper kettles or boilers, each one smaller and hotter than the previous one. The cane juice began in the largest kettle. The juice was then heated and lime added to remove impurities. The juice was skimmed and then channeled to successively smaller kettles. The last kettle, the &#34;teache&#34;, was where the cane juice became syrup. The next step was a cooling trough, where the sugar crystals hardened around a sticky core of molasses. This raw sugar was then shoveled from the cooling trough into <a href="/Hogshead" title="Hogshead">hogsheads</a> (wooden barrels), and from there into the curing house.</p>

Once a major crop of the southeastern region of the United States, sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades, and is now primarily confined to <a href="/Sugar_Cane_Growers_Cooperative_of_Florida" title="Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.</p>
<p>Sugarcane is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas with a plentiful supply of water, for a continuous period of more than six to seven months each year, either from natural rainfall or through irrigation. The crop does not tolerate severe frosts. Therefore, most of the world&#39;s sugarcane is grown between <a href="/22nd_parallel_north" title="22nd parallel north">22°N</a> and <a href="/22nd_parallel_south" title="22nd parallel south">22°S</a>, and some up to <a href="/33rd_parallel_north" title="33rd parallel north">33°N</a> and <a href="/33rd_parallel_south" title="33rd parallel south">33°S</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Something about sugar: its history, growth, manufacture and distribution|author=George Rolph|year=1873|url=<a class="external free" href="https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutsu00rolprich" rel="nofollow">https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutsu00rolprich</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; When sugarcane crop is found outside this range, such as the <a href="/KwaZulu-Natal" title="KwaZulu-Natal">Natal</a> region of South Africa, it is normally due to anomalous climatic conditions in the region, such as warm ocean currents that sweep down the coast. In terms of altitude, sugarcane crop is found up to 1,600&#38;nbsp;m close to the equator in countries such as <a href="/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web| title= Saccharum Officinarum|author=Peter Griffee|year=2000|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fao.org/landandwater/aglw/cropwater/ecosugar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/landandwater/aglw/cropwater/ecosugar.htm</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Although sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting has become the most common reproduction method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, <a href="/Billet_planting" title="Billet planting">billet planting</a> is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called <a href="/Ratoon" title="Ratoon">ratoons</a>. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made depending on the type of culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island <a href="/La_R%C3%A9union" title="La Réunion">la Réunion</a>, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.</p>

<p>Sugarcane is harvested by hand and mechanically. Hand harvesting accounts for more than half of production, and is dominant in the developing world. In hand harvesting, the field is first set on fire. The fire burns dry leaves, and chases away or kills any lurking venomous snakes, without harming the stalks and roots. Harvesters then cut the cane just above ground-level using <a href="/Cane_knife" title="Cane knife">cane knives</a> or <a href="/Machete" title="Machete">machetes</a>. A skilled harvester can cut {{convert|500|kg|lb}} of sugarcane per hour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</p>

The machine cuts the cane at the base of the stalk, strips the leaves, chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside. The harvester then blows the trash back onto the field. Such machines can harvest {{convert|100 |LT|MT}} each hour; however, harvested cane must be rapidly processed. Once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content, and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline. This decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading. Austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to, for example, the nearest railway siding. This mechanical harvesting doesn&#39;t require the field to be set on fire; the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves, which act as mulch for the next round of planting.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Processing">Processing</span></h2>
<p>Traditionally, sugarcane processing requires two stages. Mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and &#34;mill-white” sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills, intended for local consumption. Sugar crystals appear naturally in white color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules as well as to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation.&#60;ref&#62;Steindl, Roderick (2005) Syrup Clarification for Plantation White Sugar to meet New Quality Standards.

These two stages are slowly merging. Increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products, driving a trend toward combined milling and refining.</p>

<p>Particulate matter, combustion products, and volatile organic compounds are the primary pollutants emitted during the sugarcane processing.&#60;ref name=epa2005/&#62; Combustion products include nitrogen oxides (NO&#60;sub&#62;X&#60;/sub&#62;), carbon monoxide (CO), CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;, and sulfur oxides (SO&#60;sub&#62;X&#60;/sub&#62;). Potential emission sources include the sugar granulators, sugar conveying and packaging equipment, bulk loadout operations, boilers, granular carbon and char regeneration kilns, regenerated adsorbent transport systems, kilns and handling equipment (at some facilities), carbonation tanks, multi-effect evaporator stations, and vacuum boiling pans. Modern pollution prevention technologies are capable of addressing all of these potential pollutants. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}</p>

Ethanol is generally available as a byproduct of sugar production. It can be used as a <a href="/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a> alternative to gasoline, and is widely used in cars in Brazil. It is an alternative to gasoline, and may become the primary product of sugarcane processing, rather than sugar.</p>
<p>In Brazil, gasoline is required to contain at least 22 percent bioethanol.&#60;ref name=iea1&#62;{{cite web|title=IEA Energy Technology Essentials: Biofuel Production|publisher=International Energy Agency|year=2007|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.iea.org/techno/essentials2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iea.org/techno/essentials2.pdf</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; This bioethanol is sourced from Brazil&#39;s large sugarcane crop.</p>
<p>The production of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse is used to produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.&#60;ref name=iea1/&#62;</p>
<p>A textbook on renewable energy&#60;ref&#62;da Rosa, A, <i>Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Processes</i>, 2005, Elsevier, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780120885107" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780120885107">ISBN 978-0-12-088510-7</a>, pp. 501–502&#60;/ref&#62; describes the energy transformation:</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;
Presently, 75 tons of raw sugar cane are produced annually per hectare in Brazil. The cane delivered to the processing plant is called burned and cropped (b&#38;c), and represents 77% of the mass of the raw cane. The reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves (which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer), and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop. Average cane production is, therefore, 58 tons of b&#38;c per hectare per year.
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;
Each ton of b&#38;c yields 740 kg of juice (135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water) and 260 kg of moist bagasse (130 kg of dry bagasse). Since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 M<a href="/Joule" title="Joule">J</a>/kg, and that of the bagasse is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b&#38;c is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse.
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;
Per hectare per year, the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 TJ. This is equivalent to 0.86 W per square meter. Assuming an average insolation of 225 W per square meter, the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38%.
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;
The 135 kg of sucrose found in 1 ton of b&#38;c are transformed into 70 litres of ethanol with a combustion energy of 1.7 GJ. The practical sucrose-ethanol conversion efficiency is, therefore, 76% (compare with the theoretical 97%).
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;
One hectare of sugar cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year (without any additional energy input, because the bagasse produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product). This, however, does not include the energy used in tilling, transportation, and so on. Thus, the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13%.
&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bagasse_applications">Bagasse applications</span></h2>
<p>Sugarcane is a major crop in many countries. It is one of the plants with the highest bioconversion efficiency. Sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy, yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually. After harvest, the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse, the fibrous dry matter. This dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production. Bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|last1=Rainey|first1=Thomas|last2=Covey|first2=Geoff|last3=Shore|first3=Dennis|title=An analysis of Australian sugarcane regions for bagasse paper manufacture|journal=International Sugar Journal|volume=108|issue=1295|pages=640–644|url=<a class="external free" href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/6781/" rel="nofollow">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/6781/</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Sugarcane bagasse is a potentially abundant source of energy for large producers of sugarcane, such as Brazil, India and China. According to one report, with use of latest technologies, bagasse produced annually in Brazil has the potential of meeting 20 percent of Brazil’s energy consumption by 2020.&#60;ref name=bw2009/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electricity_production">Electricity production</span></h3>
<p>A number of countries, in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid. Bagasse is usually burned to produce steam, which in turn creates electricity. Current technologies, such as those in use in <a href="/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, produce over 100 KWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse. With a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year, the global energy potential from bagasse is over 100,000 GWh.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Bagasse Cogen - Global Review and Potential|publisher=World Alliance for Decentralized Energy|year=2004|url=<a class="external free" href="http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/2/K/J/2KJXDVUHFZ0MYG3WOBT91NA7QE6LP5/4057%20Annex%206%20Bagasse%20Cogeneration%20-%20Global%20Review%20and%20Potential.pdf?t=c218bHlxNnl0fDBA-OBcr9CiLo9e72XBejIQ" rel="nofollow">http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/2/K/J/2KJXDVUHFZ0MYG3WOBT91NA7QE6LP5/4057%20Annex%206%20Bagasse%20Cogeneration%20-%20Global%20Review%20and%20Potential.pdf?t=c218bHlxNnl0fDBA-OBcr9CiLo9e72XBejIQ</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; Using Mauritius as a reference, an annual potential of 10,000 GWh of additional electricity could be produced throughout <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Sugar Cane Bagasse Energy Cogeneration – Lessons from Mauritius|author=Deepchand|publisher=The United Nations| year=2005| url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/parliamentarian_forum/deepchand_bagasse.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/parliamentarian_forum/deepchand_bagasse.pdf</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; Electrical generation from bagasse could become quite important, particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations.</p>
