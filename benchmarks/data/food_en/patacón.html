<p>The <b>Patacón</b> (officially called <i>Letra de Tesorería para Cancelación de Obligaciones de la Provincia de Buenos Aires</i>) was a <a href="/Bond_(finance)" title="Bond (finance)">bond</a> issued by the government of the <a href="/Provinces_of_Argentina" title="Provinces of Argentina">province</a> of <a href="/Buenos_Aires_Province" title="Buenos Aires Province">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, during 2001. The <i>patacones</i> were used to pay government bills, including state employees&#39; salaries during a period when the <a href="/Argentine_economic_crisis" title="Argentine economic crisis">economic crisis</a> caused regular currency (<a href="/Argentine_peso" title="Argentine peso">Argentine pesos</a>) to be scarce. <i>Patacones</i> then circulated in the economy in much the same way as pesos.</p>
<p>First issued during the peso/U.S. dollar convertibility regime, just like other <a href="/Complementary_currency" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> Patacones could be attractive due to a revenue scheduled for payment in 2003 in pesos (practically equivalent to dollars). When the convertibility was abandoned amid fears of hyperinflation, the attractiveness of this revenue practically disappeared. The basis for the acceptability of <a href="/Complementary_currency" title="Complementary currency">complementary currency</a> shifted to their use to pay taxes.</p>
<p>However, the value of Patacones became eroded as the series &#34;B&#34; was issued because as a way to put pressure on the Government to cancel a large debt, the company that printed them eliminated many safety features deemed too expensive, thus making them easier to counterfeit. Also, the revenue of series &#34;B&#34; was scheduled for payment just in 2006. The economic importance of Buenos Aires province ensured the acceptability of Patacones because there were plenty of large companies that found use for them as payment of provincial charges. Patacones were accepted outside the Buenos Aires province and eventually circulated (albeit informally) in border areas of neighboring countries.</p>
<p>The name <i>patacón</i> is derived from a former Argentine national currency, and had been used in various places as a variant name for the <a href="/Peso" title="Peso">Peso</a>. It was colloquially or jokingly used as a synonym of &#34;money&#34;. The popular comic hero <a href="/Patoruz%C3%BA" title="Patoruzú">Patoruzú</a> had revived the use of this word -a wealthy, generous Indian ever ready to hand large heaps of bank notes to anyone in need, urging them to accept &#34;these Patacones&#34;.</p>
<p>Other <a href="/Complementary_currency" title="Complementary currency">complementary currencies</a> in Argentina at that time were the <a href="/Cr%C3%A9dito" title="Crédito">Crédito</a>, the <a href="/LECOP" title="LECOP">LECOP</a> and the <a href="/Argentine_argentino" title="Argentine argentino">Argentino</a>.</p>
