<p>In many cultures of the world, especially the West, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a food product. Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce <a href="/Lactase" title="Lactase">lactase</a>, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. Milk was therefore converted to <a href="/Curd" title="Curd">curd</a>, <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a> and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in Europe that enabled the <a href="/Lactase_persistence" title="Lactase persistence">production of lactase in adulthood</a>. This allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed.&#60;ref name=&#34;Nature Milk&#34;&#62;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/500020a|title=Archaeology: The milk revolution |author=Curry, Andrew |date= July 31, 2013 |journal= Nature |volume= 500|pages= 20–22|issue=7460|pmid=23903732}}&#60;/ref&#62; Milk is processed into a variety of dairy products such as <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, <a href="/Yogurt" title="Yogurt">yogurt</a>, <a href="/Kefir" title="Kefir">kefir</a>, <a href="/Ice_cream" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a>, and cheese.

The growth in urban population coupled with the expansion of the railway network in the mid-19th century, brought about a revolution in milk production and supply. Individual railway firms began transporting milk from rural areas to London from the 1840s and 1850s.

Urban demand began to grow, as consumer purchasing power increased and milk became regarded as a required daily commodity. Over the last three decades of the 19th century, demand for milk in most parts of the country doubled, or in some cases, tripled. <a href="/Public_Health_Acts" title="Public Health Acts">Legislation in 1875</a> made the adulteration of milk illegal - this combined with a marketing campaign to change the image of milk. The proportion of rural imports by rail as a percentage of total milk consumption in London grew from under 5% in the 1860s to over 96% by the early 20th century. By that point, the supply system for milk was the most highly organized and integrated of any food product.&#60;ref name=&#34;Atkins&#34; /&#62;</p>

FAO reports&#60;ref name=gs12/&#62; Israel dairy farms are the most productive in the world, with a yield of {{convert|12,546|kg|lbs}} milk per cow per year. This survey over 2001 and 2007 was conducted by ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.icar.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icar.org/</a>|title=ICAR - International Committee for Animal Recording|work=icar.org}}&#60;/ref&#62;) across 17 developed countries. The survey found that the average herd size in these developed countries increased from 74 to 99 cows per herd between 2001 to 2007. A dairy farm had an average of 19 cows per herd in Norway, and 337 in New Zealand. Annual milk production in the same period increased from {{convert|7,726| to|8,550|kg|abbr=on}} per cow in these developed countries. The lowest average production was in New Zealand at {{convert|3,974|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per cow. The milk yield per cow depended on production systems, nutrition of the cows, and only to a minor extent different genetic potential of the animals.

<p>Minerals or milk salts, are traditional names for a variety of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 5–40 mM. The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated5&#34;/&#62; In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins. Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, biotin, riboflavin, folates, and pantothenic acid are all present in milk.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Calcium_phosphate_structure">Calcium phosphate structure</span></h4>
<p>For many years the most accepted theory of the structure of a micelle was that it was composed of spherical casein aggregates, called submicelles, that were held together by calcium phosphate linkages. However, there are two recent models of the casein micelle that refute the distinct micellular structures within the micelle.</p>
<p>The first theory attributed to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellular structure. Specifically in this view, unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate giving rise to their structure and thus no specific structure is formed.</p>
<p>The second theory proposed by Horne, the growth of calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins. Once bound, protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs, in which K-casein is used as an end cap, to form micelles with trapped calcium phosphate nanoclusters.</p>
<p>Some sources indicate that the trapped calcium phosphate is in the form of Ca9(PO4)6;
whereas, others say it is similar to the structure of the mineral brushite CaHPO4 -2H2O.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/chem.html" rel="nofollow">chemistry and physics</a>. Foodsci.uoguelph.ca. Retrieved on December 9, 2011.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Pasteurization is used to kill harmful <a href="/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a> by heating the milk for a short time and then immediately cooling it. The standard high temperature short time (HTST) process produces a 99.999% reduction in the number of bacteria in milk, rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated. Dairies print <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">expiration dates</a> on each container, after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves.</p>

Upon standing for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in <a href="/Centrifuge" title="Centrifuge">centrifugal</a> <a href="/Cream_separator" title="Cream separator">cream separators</a>. The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow&#39;s milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins.&#60;ref name=&#34;On Food and Cooking&#34;/&#62; These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}</p>

<p>===Lactose intolerance===&#60;!-- This section is linked from Milk --&#62;
{{Main|lactose intolerance}}
Lactose, the <a href="/Disaccharide" title="Disaccharide">disaccharide</a> sugar component of all milk, must be cleaved in the small intestine by the enzyme, lactase, in order for its constituents, <a href="/Galactose" title="Galactose">galactose</a> and <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a>, to be absorbed. The production of the enzyme lactase declines significantly after <a href="/Weaning" title="Weaning">weaning</a> in all mammals. Consequently, many humans become unable to digest lactose properly as they mature. There is a great deal of variance, with some individuals reacting badly to even small amounts of lactose, some able to consume moderate quantities, and some able to consume large quantities of milk and other dairy products without problems. The gene in humans that controls lactase production, and hence lactose tolerance and intolerance, is labeled <a href="/Lactase_persistence" title="Lactase persistence">C/T-13910</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Babu, J. 2009&#34;&#62;{{Cite journal | last1 = Babu | first1 = J. | last2 = Kumar | first2 = S. | last3 = Babu | first3 = P. | last4 = Prasad | first4 = J.

Studies could find no association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics published a report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women for more than two decades. Subjects were asked to report on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed to see if there is any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in <i>The <a href="/BMJ" title="BMJ">BMJ</a></i> that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results.

<p>Milk preserved by the <a href="/Ultra-high-temperature_processing" title="Ultra-high-temperature processing">UHT</a> process does not need to be refrigerated before opening and has a longer shelf life than milk in ordinary packaging.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reduction_or_elimination_of_lactose">Reduction or elimination of lactose</span></h3>
<p>Lactose-free milk can be produced by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk.</p>

<p>Due to the short shelf life of normal milk, it used to be delivered to households daily in many countries; however, improved refrigeration at home, changing food shopping patterns because of supermarkets, and the higher cost of home delivery mean that daily deliveries by a <a href="/Milkman" title="Milkman">milkman</a> are no longer available in most countries.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, prior to <a href="/Metrication" title="Metrication">metrication</a>, milk was generally distributed in 1 pint (568ml) glass bottles. In Australia and Ireland there was a government funded &#34;free milk for school children&#34; program, and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles. With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry were concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500ml bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons. A number of designs were used, including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space, and could not be knocked over accidentally. (slogan: No more crying over spilt milk.) However, the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the United States.&#60;ref name=wwwa&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110706113759/http://www.zerowastewa.com.au/documents/liquidpboard_fs.pdf" rel="nofollow">Milk and Juice Cartons Fact Sheet</a>, Waste Wise WA, zerowastewa.com.au.

<p>Milk is now available in a variety of sizes in cardboard cartons (250&#38;nbsp;mL, 375&#38;nbsp;mL, 600&#38;nbsp;mL, 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1, 2 and 3 liters). A significant addition to the marketplace has been &#34;long-life&#34; milk (<a href="/UHT" title="UHT">UHT</a>), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons. In urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand, home delivery is still available, though in suburban areas this is often 3 times per week rather than daily.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h4>

<p>In rural <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, milk is home delivered, daily, by local milkmen carrying bulk quantities in a metal container, usually on a bicycle. In other parts of metropolitan <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, milk is usually bought or delivered in plastic bags or cartons via shops or supermarkets.</p>
<p>The current milk chain flow in India is from milk producer to milk collection agent. Then it is transported to a milk chilling center and bulk transported to the processing plant, then to the sales agent and finally to the consumer.</p>
<p>A 2011 survey by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India found that nearly 70 per cent of samples had not conformed to the standards set for milk. The study found that due to lack of hygiene and sanitation in milk handling and packaging, detergents (used during cleaning operations) were not washed properly and found their way into the milk. About eight per cent of samples in the survey were found to have detergents, which are hazardous to health.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=Adulterated milk is what Indians are drinking |url=<a class="external free" href="http://cseindia.org/content/adulterated-milk-what-indians-are-drinking" rel="nofollow">http://cseindia.org/content/adulterated-milk-what-indians-are-drinking</a> |work=Centre for Science and Environment |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Since the late 1990s, milk-buying patterns have changed drastically in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>.

Two of the main reasons for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news |last=Coughlan |first=Sean |url=<a class="external free" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4850336.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4850336.stm</a> |title=Milk&#39;s online top-up |work=BBC News |date=March 28, 2006 |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62; By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=Find me a Milkman – I want doorstep deliveries! |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.dairyuk.org/for-consumers-mainmenu-278/find-me-a-milkman-mainmenu-290" rel="nofollow">http://www.dairyuk.org/for-consumers-mainmenu-278/find-me-a-milkman-mainmenu-290</a> |publisher=Dairy UK |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62; Assuming that delivery per milkman is the same as it was in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/products/roadmaps/milk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/products/roadmaps/milk.htm</a>|title=&#34;Milk product roadmaps&#34;, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

In the United States, glass milk bottles have been replaced mostly with <a href="/Milk_carton" title="Milk carton">milk cartons</a> and plastic jugs. Gallons of milk are almost always sold in jugs, while half gallons and quarts may be found in both paper cartons and plastic jugs, and smaller sizes are almost always in cartons.</p>
<p>The &#34;half pint&#34; {{convert|.5|USpt}} milk carton is the traditional unit as a component of school lunches, though some companies have replaced that unit size with a plastic bottle, which is also available at retail in 6- and 12-pack size.</p>

Some of these products include <a href="/Sour_cream" title="Sour cream">sour cream</a>, <a href="/Yogurt" title="Yogurt">yogurt</a>, <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, <a href="/Buttermilk" title="Buttermilk">buttermilk</a>, <a href="/Viili" title="Viili">viili</a>, <a href="/Kefir" title="Kefir">kefir</a>, and <a href="/Kumis" title="Kumis">kumis</a>. <i>See <a href="/Dairy_product" title="Dairy product">Dairy product</a></i> for more information.</p>
<p><a href="/Pasteurization" title="Pasteurization">Pasteurization</a> of cow&#39;s milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption. This causes it to assume an <a href="/Unpleasant_odor" title="Unpleasant odor">unpleasant odor</a>, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and an increased risk of <a href="/Food_poisoning" title="Food poisoning">food poisoning</a>. In raw milk, the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing <a href="/Acid" title="Acid">acidity</a> in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed.</p>
<p>In order to prevent spoilage, milk can be kept <a href="/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerated</a> and stored between {{convert|1|and|4|C}} in <a href="/Bulk_tank" title="Bulk tank">bulk tanks</a>. Most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from <a href="/Factory_farming" title="Factory farming">factory farms</a> to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (<a href="/UHT" title="UHT">UHT</a>) treatment. Milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic &#34;cooked&#34; taste. <a href="/Condensed_milk" title="Condensed milk">Condensed milk</a>, made by removing most of the water, can be stored in cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can <a href="/Evaporated_milk" title="Evaporated milk">evaporated milk</a>.

The importance of milk in human culture is attested to by the numerous expressions embedded in our languages, for example, &#34;the milk of human kindness&#34;. In ancient <a href="/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the <a href="/Goddess" title="Goddess">goddess</a> <a href="/Hera" title="Hera">Hera</a> spilled her <a href="/Breast" title="Breast">breast</a> milk after refusing to feed <a href="/Heracles" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>, resulting in the <a href="/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>.</p>
<p>In many <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">African</a> and <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asian</a> countries, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> is traditionally made from fermented milk rather than cream. It can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.&#60;ref&#62;Crawford <i>et al.</i>, part B, section III, ch. 1: <a class="external text" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/t0251e/T0251E15.htm#ch1" rel="nofollow">Butter</a>. Retrieved November 28, 2005.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Holy books have also mentioned milk. The Bible contains references to the &#39;<a href="/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Land of Milk and Honey</a>&#39;. In the <a href="/Qur&#39;an" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a>, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: &#39;And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers.&#39;(16-The Honeybee, 66). The <a href="/Ramadan" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> fast is traditionally broken with a glass of milk and dates.</p>
<p><a href="/Abhisheka" title="Abhisheka">Abhisheka</a> is conducted by <a href="/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="/Jainism" title="Jainism">Jain</a> priests, by pouring libations on the <a href="/Murti" title="Murti">image of a deity</a> being worshipped, amidst the chanting of <a href="/Mantra" title="Mantra">mantras</a>. Usually offerings such as milk, <a href="/Yogurt" title="Yogurt">yogurt</a>, <a href="/Ghee" title="Ghee">ghee</a>, <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed.</p>
<p>To milk someone, in the vernacular of many English-speaking countries, is to take advantage of the person.</p>
<p>The word &#34;milk&#34; has had many slang meanings over time. In the 19th century, milk was used to describe a cheap alcoholic drink made from methylated spirits mixed with water. The word was also used to mean defraud, to be idle, to intercept telegrams addressed to someone else, and a weakling or &#39;milksop&#39;. In the mid-1930s, the word was used in Australia meaning to siphon gas from a car.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite book|url=<a class="external free" href="https://books.google.com/?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&#38;pg=PA943" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&#38;pg=PA943</a>|author=Green, Jonathon|page=943 |title=Cassell&#39;s Dictionary of Slang |publisher=Weidenfeld &#38; Nicholson|isbn=978-0-304-36636-1|year=2005}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
