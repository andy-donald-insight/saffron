<p>Many items of traditional goods are produced from tallow, which was widely available domestically.  Tallow can also be used as <a href="/Flux_(metallurgy)" title="Flux (metallurgy)">flux</a> for <a href="/Soldering" title="Soldering">soldering</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.fantasyinglass.com/fantasyinglass.com/Tech_Help-Flux.html" rel="nofollow">Hey Flux&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62; It is also the primary ingredient in some leather conditioners. Tallow used to be used commonly in high-end shaving soaps, in particular those of elite British firms such as <a href="/Geo._F_Trumper" title="Geo. F Trumper">Geo. F Trumper</a>, <a href="/Truefitt_%26_Hill" title="Truefitt &amp; Hill">Truefitt &#38; Hill</a>, and Taylor of Old Bond Street.  While these firms have reformulated to a vegetable base, tallow-based soaps still exist, including the soaps from American firms, Williams Mug Shaving Soap, Nod Hill Soap, and soaps from Turkey and Italy.</p>
<p>Tallow also has a use in printmaking where it is combined with <a href="/Asphalt" title="Asphalt">bitumen</a> and applied to metal print plates to provide a resist to acid etching.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historic_applications">Historic applications</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Biblical_mention">Biblical mention</span></h4>
<p>In Leviticus 3:14-17 the Israelites are forbidden to eat the <a href="/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a> surrounding certain internal organs of animals (e.g. cows and sheep) <a href="/Korban" title="Korban">sacrificed at the Temple</a>. This suet is <a href="/Halakha" title="Halakha">Halakhically</a> called <i><a href="/Chelev" title="Chelev">chelev</a></i>. English Bible translations sometimes translate <i>chelev</i> to &#34;tallow&#34;, although strictly speaking this is incorrect: only tallow from species offered for sacrifice at the Temple is forbidden, and tallow from other (typically wild) kosher quadrupeds (e.g. deer) is not forbidden.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Candles">Candles</span></h4>
<p>Tallow once was widely used to make moulded <a href="/Candle" title="Candle">candles</a> before more convenient wax varieties became available—and for some time after, as they continued to be a cheaper alternative. For those too poor even to avail themselves of homemade, moulded tallow candles, the &#34;tallow dip&#34;—a strip of burning cloth in a saucer of tallow grease—was an accessible substitute.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lubrication">Lubrication</span></h4>
<p>Early in the development of steam-driven piston engines, the hot vapors and liquids washed away most lubricants very quickly. It was soon found that tallow was quite resistant to this washing. Tallow and compounds including tallow were widely used to lubricate locomotive and steamship engines at least until the 1950s. (During WWII, the vast fleets of steam-powered ships exhausted the supply, leading to the large-scale planting of <a href="/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a> because rapeseed oil also resisted the washing effect.)  Tallow is still used in the <a href="/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> rolling industry to provide the required lubrication as the sheet steel is compressed through the <a href="/Steel_rollers" title="Steel rollers">steel rollers</a>. There is a trend toward replacing tallow-based <a href="/Lubrication" title="Lubrication">lubrication</a> with synthetic oils in rolling applications for surface cleanliness reasons.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4891161-description.html" rel="nofollow">Cold rolling mill lubricant - US Patent 4891161&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The use of tallow or lard to lubricate rifles was the spark that started the <a href="/Indian_Mutiny_of_1857" title="Indian Mutiny of 1857">Indian Mutiny of 1857</a>. To load the new <a href="/Pattern_1853_Enfield_Rifle" title="Pattern 1853 Enfield Rifle">Pattern 1853 Enfield Rifle</a>, the <a href="/Sepoy" title="Sepoy">sepoys</a> had to bite the cartridge open. It was believed that the paper cartridges that were standard issue with the rifle were greased with lard (pork fat), which was regarded as <a href="/Najis" title="Najis">unclean by Muslims</a>, or tallow (cow fat), which is incompatible with <a href="/Diet_in_Hinduism" title="Diet in Hinduism">Hindu dietary laws</a>. Tallow, along with <a href="/Beeswax" title="Beeswax">beeswax</a>, was also used in the lubricant for American Civil War ammunition used in the <a href="/Springfield_musket" title="Springfield musket">Springfield rifled musket</a>.  A combination of mutton tallow, paraffin wax and beeswax is still used as a patch or projectile lubricant in present day black powder arms.</p>
<p>Tallow is used to make a biodegradable motor oil by a <a href="/Stamford%2C_Connecticut" title="Stamford, Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>-based company called <a href="/Green_Earth_Technologies" title="Green Earth Technologies">Green Earth Technologies</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news| url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/automobiles/08BIO.html?nl=wheels&#38;emc=wheelsa2" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/automobiles/08BIO.html?nl=wheels&#38;emc=wheelsa2</a> | work=The New York Times | first=Jim | last=Motavalli | title=Oil Goes ‘Green,&#39; With the Help of Some Cows | date=5 February 2009}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
