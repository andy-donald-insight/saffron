<b>Corn Pops</b> is a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> made by <a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg&#39;s</a>, described by the company as &#34;crunchy sweetened popped-up corn cereal.&#34; Originally called <b>Sugar Pops</b>, it was introduced in 1951 as the sponsor for &#34;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&#34; television show.  The name was changed to <b>Sugar Corn Pops</b> in 1978, and finally to Corn Pops in 1984, a time when many cereals dropped the word &#34;Sugar&#34; from their titles. In January 2006, the name of the cereal was changed to <b>Pops</b>, but after a few months of poor reception, was changed back to Corn Pops. Sometimes, this cereal is just referred to as Pops.</p>
<p>In mid-2007, Corn Pops launched its first line extension in many years called &#34;Chocolate Peanut Butter Pops.&#34;  In 2012, &#34;Cinnamon Corn Pops&#34; were introduced.</p>

<p>Corn Pops are made from milled <a href="/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a> and the American version has a flattened, smooth, bumpy shape. Canadian Corn Pops look very different; they are spherical and have a porous surface, similar to <a href="/Kix_(cereal)" title="Kix (cereal)">Kix cereal</a>. The taste and texture of the Canadian and American versions of the cereal differ considerably despite sharing the same name and manufacturer.  Kellogg&#39;s says this is due to raw ingredients and the regulatory agencies that exist in a particular country, and that its cereal differs by country also by virtue of marketing and culture.  Research is done in different countries to determine preferences, and the formula for the cereal is changed accordingly, affecting the texture, color, and nutrition.  The <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a>, <a href="/Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, and <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> content is the same.</p>
<p>Unlike the vast majority of breakfast cereals, Corn Pops in the USA had been packaged in a <a href="/Aluminium_foil" title="Aluminium foil">foil</a>-lined bag until the mid-2010s.  This helped to prevent the Pops from going stale and from secreting a sticky substance that caused the corn pops to stick together (a problem caused by the method by which the cereal is processed).&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mfoilbag.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mfoilbag.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; <a href="/Honey_Smacks" title="Honey Smacks">Honey Smacks</a>, another Kellogg&#39;s puffed grain cereal, used the same bag Corn Pops used. However, the Canadian version of Corn Pops had long been packaged in a standard plastic cereal bag, now used for American pops as well.</p>

Pete and the other actors in the commercial sang the jingle: &#34;Oh, the Pops are sweeter and the taste is new. They&#39;re shot with sugar, through and through...Sugar Pops are tops!&#34; From 1968 to 1977, the mascot was the &#34;Whippersnapper,&#34; a live-action, whip-cracking cowboy. From 1980 to 1983, a female porcupine named &#34;Poppy&#34; represented the cereal. Poppy carried around a yellow suitcase which contained a complete breakfast setting, meeting the by-then industry-standard &#34;part of a complete breakfast&#34; tagline. In early 2009, a live actor dressed up as a Corn Pops puff became the new mascot of Corn Pops. Then, in mid-2009, Kellogg&#39;s introduced an alternative mascot named the &#34;Sweet Toothasaur,&#34; consisting of the upside down bottom half of an actor&#39;s face, with a green felt cap with googly eyes and red paper horns on the actor&#39;s chin.</p>

<p>Unlike American Corn Pops, in Canada and in Europe (in France it is called Miel Pops - meaning Honey Pops) the cereal consists of small, spherical, uniform balls. Both versions are crunchier and have a different taste.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}</p>
