<p>The earliest known version, in Mary Eaton&#39;s &#39;The Cook and Housekeeper&#39;s Dictionary&#39; of 1823, predates baking powder and therefore uses a breadcrumb-and-egg sponge.</p>
<p><b>Mother Eves pudding</b> from 1860 contained apples, but with suet and was boiled.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Method">Method</span></h2>
<p>&#34;Take of sliced apple, well washed currants, grated bread, and finely shred suet, each twelve ounces, mix them in a bowl, with half the rind of a lemon, minced, and moisten with four well-beaten eggs. Boil in a buttered mould, and serve with a sweet sauce, as follows:- Sweeten a quarter of a pint of melted butter, add nutmeg, a large glassful of sherry, and part of the juice of a lemon.
Time: 3 hours to boil.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2009/04/mother-eves-pudding.html" rel="nofollow">Mother Eves Pudding</a> from TheOldFoodie.com, retrieved 28 December 2014&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
