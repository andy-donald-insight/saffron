<p><i>Peanuts</i> had its origin in <i><a href="/Li&#39;l_Folks" title="Li&#39;l Folks">Li&#39;l Folks</a></i>, a weekly panel comic that appeared in Schulz&#39;s hometown paper, the <i><a href="/St._Paul_Pioneer_Press" title="St. Paul Pioneer Press">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a></i>, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name <i>Charlie Brown</i> for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of <a href="/Snoopy" title="Snoopy">Snoopy</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<i>Li&#39;l Folks&#38;nbsp;– Charles M. Schulz: Li&#39;l Beginnings</i> Derrick Bang&#38;nbsp;– With Foreword by Jean Schulz 2003 Charles M. Schulz Museum <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974570915" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974570915">ISBN 0-9745709-1-5</a>&#60;/ref&#62; In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to <i><a href="/The_Saturday_Evening_Post" title="The Saturday Evening Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a></i> which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with his feet on an ottoman.</p>
<p>In 1948, Schulz tried to have <i>Li&#39;l Folks</i> syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} <i>Li&#39;l Folks</i> was dropped in early 1950. Later that year, Schulz approached the <a href="/United_Feature_Syndicate" title="United Feature Syndicate">United Feature Syndicate</a> with his best work from <i>Li&#39;l Folks</i>. When his work was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The name <i>Li&#39;l Folks</i> was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: <a href="/Al_Capp" title="Al Capp">Al Capp</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/Li&#39;l_Abner" title="Li&#39;l Abner">Li&#39;l Abner</a></i> and a strip titled <i>Little Folks</i>. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name <i>Peanuts</i>, after the <a href="/Peanut_gallery" title="Peanut gallery">peanut gallery</a> featured in the <i><a href="/Howdy_Doody" title="Howdy Doody">Howdy Doody</a></i> TV show.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/lection/080105.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/lection/080105.html</a>|title=Schulz and Peanuts|last=Morris|first=Tim|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&#60;/ref&#62; <i>Peanuts</i> was a title Schulz always disliked. In a 1987 interview, Schulz said of the title <i>Peanuts</i>: &#34;It&#39;s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity—and I think my humor has dignity.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news | first=Heather | last=McKinnon | title=Seattle&#39;s Fantagraphics Books will release &#39;The Complete Peanuts&#39; | date= February 15, 2004 | publisher=The Seattle Times | url=<a class="external free" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2001857267_peanuts15.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2001857267_peanuts15.html</a> }}&#60;/ref&#62; The periodic collections of the strips in paperback book form typically had either &#34;Charlie Brown&#34; or &#34;Snoopy&#34; in the title, not &#34;Peanuts&#34;, because of Schulz&#39; distaste for his strip&#39;s title. From November 20, 1966 to January 4, 1987, the opening Sunday panels typically read <i>Peanuts, featuring Good Ol &#39; Charlie Brown</i>.</p>

<p><i>Peanuts</i> premiered on October 2, 1950, in nine newspapers: <i><a href="/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="/The_Chicago_Tribune" title="The Chicago Tribune">The Chicago Tribune</a>, <a href="/The_Minneapolis_Tribune" title="The Minneapolis Tribune">The Minneapolis Tribune</a></i>, <i>The <a href="/Allentown%2C_Pennsylvania" title="Allentown, Pennsylvania">Allentown Morning</a> Call</i>, <i>The <a href="/Bethlehem%2C_Pennsylvania" title="Bethlehem, Pennsylvania">Bethlehem</a> Globe-Times</i>, <i><a href="/The_Denver_Post" title="The Denver Post">The Denver Post</a></i>, <i><a href="/The_Seattle_Times" title="The Seattle Times">The Seattle Times</a></i>, <i>The <a href="/New_York_World-Telegram_%26_Sun" title="New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun">New York World-Telegram &#38; Sun</a></i>, and <i><a href="/The_Boston_Globe" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a></i>. It began as a daily strip. The first strip was four panels long and showed Charlie Brown walking by two other young children, Shermy and Patty. Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. This was groundbreaking. Until then, rarely had children expressed hatred for others in comic strips. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4. Its first <a href="/Sunday_strip" title="Sunday strip">Sunday strip</a> appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became the main characters of Peanuts did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), &#34;Peppermint&#34; Patty (August 1966), Woodstock (introduced April 1967; given a name in June 1970), Franklin (July 1968), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).</p>
<p>Schulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. (Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of <i>Peanuts</i>.)&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=<a class="external free" href="http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/" rel="nofollow">http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/</a> |title=Dale Hale and the &#34;Peanuts&#34; Comic Book: The Interview &#38;#124; Hogan&#39;s Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date=2015-05-17 |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&#60;/ref&#62; Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz&#39;s frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing &#34;its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;Masters&#34;&#62;<i>Masters of American Comics</i> John Carlin Yale University Press 2005&#60;/ref&#62; Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: &#34;This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=<a class="external free" href="http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/" rel="nofollow">http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/</a> |title=Charles M.

<p>While the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown&#39;s famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or <a href="/Rugby_union_ball" title="Rugby union ball">rugby football</a>. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. &#60;!--need facts for the entire paragraph--&#62;</p>

Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as he assumed them to be self-evident in the first place. Peppermint Patty&#39;s athletic skill and self-confidence is simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin&#39;s presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood.

<p><i>Peanuts</i> did not shy away from cartoon violence. The most obvious example might be Charlie Brown&#39;s annual, futile effort to kick the football while Lucy holds it. At the last moment, she would pull the ball away just as he was kicking. The off-balance Charlie Brown would sail into the air and land on his back with a loud thud. There was also the ever-present (and often executed) threat by Lucy to &#34;slug&#34; someone, especially her brother Linus. Though violence would happen from time to time, only once or twice was a boy ever depicted hitting a girl (Charlie Brown, who accidentally hit Lucy; when Lucy complained about it, Charlie Brown went down to her psychiatric booth where she returned the slug much harder) August 8, 1965.</p>
<p>During the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first greets Charlie Brown&#39;s beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with the Caucasian Sally.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=<a class="external free" href="http://cartoonician.com/crossing-the-color-line-in-black-and-white-franklin-in-peanuts/" rel="nofollow">http://cartoonician.com/crossing-the-color-line-in-black-and-white-franklin-in-peanuts/</a> |title=Crossing the Color Line (in Black and White): Franklin in &#34;Peanuts&#34; &#38;#124; Hogan&#39;s Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date=2015-05-17 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><i>Peanuts</i> touched on religious themes on many occasions, most notably the classic television special <i><a href="/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas" title="A Charlie Brown Christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></i> in 1965, which features the character <a href="/Linus_van_Pelt" title="Linus van Pelt">Linus van Pelt</a> quoting the <a href="/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version of the Bible</a> (Luke 2:8–14) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>, many have interpreted Schulz&#39; work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/</a> |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=<a href="/ImageTexT" title="ImageTexT">ImageTexT</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, during Schulz&#39; negotiations with <a href="/United_Feature_Syndicate" title="United Feature Syndicate">United Feature Syndicate</a> over a new contract, syndicate president William C.

<p>The daily <i>Peanuts</i> strips were formatted in a four-panel &#34;space saving&#34; format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. In 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly after the lettering became larger to accommodate the shrinking format. Beginning on <a href="/Leap_Day" title="Leap Day">Leap Day</a> in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
&#60;!--- Each sentence of this section requires separate citations/references: Schulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process. Starting in the 1980s his artistic line started to shake. This became more noticeable in the 1990s, along with his format change; depending on one&#39;s view, the art deteriorated at this point, especially where character expression was concerned, however this is highly subjective and difficult to estimate.--&#62;</p>
<p>Schulz continued the strip until his retirement resulting from failing health; he died the day before the final Sunday strip was published.</p>

<p>The final daily original <i>Peanuts</i> comic strip was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.</p>
<p>On February 13, 2000, the day following Schulz&#39;s death, the last-ever new <i>Peanuts</i> strip ran in papers. The strip, which was three panels in length, began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with &#34;No, I think he&#39;s writing.&#34; The panel next to it shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter, addressed as &#34;Dear Friends&#34;. The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz&#39;s January 3 strip, complete with the same note he wrote to the fans which reads as follows:</p>
<p>{{quote|Dear Friends,&#60;br /&#62;
I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition.&#60;br /&#62;
Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip. My family does not wish &#34;Peanuts&#34; to be <a href="/Zombie_strip" title="Zombie strip">continued by anyone else</a>, therefore I am announcing my retirement.&#60;br /&#62;
I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip.&#60;br /&#62;
Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy... how can I ever forget them...&#60;br /&#62;
— Charles M. Schulz}}</p>
<p>Many other cartoonists paid tribute to <i>Peanuts</i> and Schulz by homages in their own strips, appearing on February 13, 2000 or in the week beforehand.{{citation needed| date = February 2012}} The comic was reprinted the day after that, but only had the farewell letter. After <i>Peanuts</i> ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title <i>Classic Peanuts</i>. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.</p>
<p>Despite the end of the strip, <i>Peanuts</i> continues to be prevalent in multiple media, through widespread syndication, the publication of <i>The Complete Peanuts</i>, the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and <a href="/Peanuts_Motion_Comics" title="Peanuts Motion Comics">Peanuts Motion Comics</a>. Additionally, <a href="/BOOM!_Studios" title="BOOM! Studios">BOOM! Studios</a> has published a series of comic books, which feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of the new material is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.</p>
<p>Universal Uclick&#39;s website, GoComics.com, announced on Jan 5, 2015 that they would be launching what they called &#34;Peanuts Begins&#34;, which is simply the entire history of the strip rerun from the beginning, in colorized form. They did this to honor the sixty-fifth anniversary of the debut of <i>Peanuts</i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://blogs.gocomics.com/2015/01/new-comic-alert-peanuts-begins-by-charles-schulz-.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.gocomics.com/2015/01/new-comic-alert-peanuts-begins-by-charles-schulz-.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

The initial cast of <i>Peanuts</i> was small, featuring only <a href="/Charlie_Brown" title="Charlie Brown">Charlie Brown</a>, <a href="/Shermy_(Peanuts)" title="Shermy (Peanuts)">Shermy</a>, <a href="/Patty_(Peanuts)" title="Patty (Peanuts)">Patty</a> (not to be confused with <a href="/Peppermint_Patty" title="Peppermint Patty">Peppermint Patty</a>) and (two days after the release of the first strip) a <a href="/Beagle" title="Beagle">beagle</a>, <a href="/Snoopy" title="Snoopy">Snoopy</a>. The first addition, <a href="/Violet_Gray" title="Violet Gray">Violet</a>, was made on February 7, 1951. Other character introductions that soon followed were <a href="/Schroeder_(Peanuts)" title="Schroeder (Peanuts)">Schroeder</a>, on May 30, 1951, as a baby; <a href="/Lucy_van_Pelt" title="Lucy van Pelt">Lucy</a>, on March 3, 1952; Lucy&#39;s baby brother <a href="/Linus_van_Pelt" title="Linus van Pelt">Linus</a>, on September 19, 1952 (after his existence was first mentioned back on July 14); and <a href="/Pig-Pen" title="Pig-Pen">Pig-Pen</a>, on July 13, 1954.</p>
<p>Though the strip did not have a lead character at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz&#39; formative years. In early strips Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown&#39;s main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a <a href="/Kite_flying" title="Kite flying">kite</a> successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his <a href="/Inferiority_complex" title="Inferiority complex">inferiority complex</a> was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved <a href="/Romantic_love" title="Romantic love">romantic</a> attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958 Charlie Brown&#39;s father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by <a href="/Hallmark_Cards" title="Hallmark Cards">Hallmark Cards</a>. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969 as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for <a href="/Apollo_10" title="Apollo 10">Apollo 10</a>.</p>
<p>As the years went by, Shermy, Patty and Violet appeared less often and were demoted to supporting roles (eventually disappearing from the strip in 1969, 1976, and 1984 respectively, although Patty and Violet were still seen as late as April 9, 1995), while new major characters were introduced. Schroeder, Lucy van Pelt, and her brother Linus debuted as very young children—with Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal. Snoopy also started to verbalize his thoughts via <a href="/Thought_bubble" title="Thought bubble">thought bubbles</a>.</p>
<p>One recurring theme in the strip is Charlie Brown&#39;s neighborhood baseball team. Charlie Brown is the <a href="/Player-manager" title="Player-manager">player-manager</a> of the team and, usually, its <a href="/Pitcher" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a>, and Schroeder is the <a href="/Catcher" title="Catcher">catcher</a>. The other characters of the strip comprise the rest of the team, including Linus playing as <a href="/Second_baseman" title="Second baseman">second baseman</a> and Lucy as <a href="/Right_fielder" title="Right fielder">right fielder</a>. Charlie Brown is a terrible pitcher, often giving up tremendous hits which either knock him off the mound or leave him with only his shorts on. The team itself is also poor, with only Snoopy, at <a href="/Shortstop" title="Shortstop">shortstop</a>, being particularly competent. Because of this, the team consistently loses. However, while the team is often referred to as &#34;win-less,&#34; it does win at least ten games over the course of the strip&#39;s run, most of these when Charlie Brown is <i>not</i> playing, a fact that Charlie Brown finds highly dispiriting.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.apeanutscollectorclub.com/peantfaq.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.apeanutscollectorclub.com/peantfaq.txt</a> | title=Peanuts FAQ | accessdate=October 1, 2006}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>&#60;!-- FAIR USE of Snoopy wwi ace lb.jpg: see image description page at <a class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snoopy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snoopy</a> wwi ace lb.jpg for rationale --&#62;In the  late 1950s, Snoopy, a character previously minor, began to have a gradual increase in appearance, and in the 1960s, he became a major character. The naming of the command module and lunar module for <a href="/Apollo_10" title="Apollo 10">Apollo 10</a> – &#34;Charlie Brown&#34; and &#34;Snoopy&#34; respectively, as mentioned earlier in this text, is testament to the character&#39;s standing at that time. Many of the strips from the 1960s onwards revolve around Snoopy&#39;s active, <a href="/Walter_Mitty" title="Walter Mitty">Walter Mitty</a>-like fantasy life, in which he would imagine himself in various roles, including a World War One Flying Ace, a World Famous author, and a college student named Joe Cool. Although the names give his imaginary roles self-praise, he fails in his fantasies.</p>
<p>Schulz continued to introduce new characters into the strip, particularly including a tomboyish, freckle-faced, shorts-and-sandals-wearing girl named Patricia Reichardt, better known as Peppermint Patty. Peppermint Patty is an assertive, athletic but rather obtuse girl who shakes up Charlie Brown&#39;s world by calling him &#34;Chuck&#34;, flirting with him and giving him compliments he is not so sure he deserves. She also brings in a new group of friends (and heads a rival baseball team), including the strip&#39;s first black character, <a href="/Franklin_(Peanuts)" title="Franklin (Peanuts)">Franklin</a>; a Mexican-Swedish kid named <a href="/Jos%C3%A9_Peterson" title="José Peterson">José Peterson</a>, and Peppermint Patty&#39;s bookish sidekick <a href="/Marcie_(Peanuts)" title="Marcie (Peanuts)">Marcie</a>, who calls Peppermint Patty &#34;Sir&#34; and Charlie Brown &#34;Charles&#34; and sometimes &#34;Chuck&#34; (most characters only referred to him as &#34;Charlie Brown&#34;, though he was known as &#34;Charles&#34; to <a href="/Eudora_(Peanuts)" title="Eudora (Peanuts)">Eudora</a>, &#34;big brother&#34; to his sister <a href="/Sally_Brown" title="Sally Brown">Sally Brown</a>, &#34;that round-headed kid&#34; to Snoopy, and as &#34;Brownie Charles&#34; to <a href="/Peggy_Jean" title="Peggy Jean">Peggy Jean</a> after misspeaking his name out of nervousness).</p>
<p>Several additional family members of the characters were also introduced: Charlie Brown&#39;s younger sister Sally, who became fixated on Linus; Linus and Lucy van Pelt&#39;s younger brother <a href="/Rerun_van_Pelt" title="Rerun van Pelt">Rerun</a>, who almost always found himself on the back of his mother&#39;s bike for a time; and <a href="/Spike_(Peanuts)" title="Spike (Peanuts)">Spike</a>, Snoopy&#39;s desert-dwelling brother from <a href="/Needles%2C_California" title="Needles, California">Needles, California</a>, who was apparently named for Schulz&#39; own childhood dog.&#60;ref&#62;See <a href="/Charles_M._Schulz" title="Charles M. Schulz">Charles M. Schulz</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Snoopy also had <a href="/Snoopy&#39;s_siblings" title="Snoopy&#39;s siblings">six other siblings</a>, and a total of five of his siblings made some appearances in the strip (his brothers Andy, Olaf, and Marbles (in addition to Spike) and his sister Belle).</p>
<p>Other notable characters include Snoopy&#39;s friend Woodstock, a bird whose chirping is represented in print as hash marks but is nevertheless clearly understood by Snoopy; three of <a href="/List_of_minor_characters_in_Peanuts#Woodstock.27s_bird_friends" title="List of minor characters in Peanuts">Woodstock&#39;s buddies</a> who usually appeared when on a scouting trip with Snoopy as their scout leader; Pig-Pen, the perpetually dirty boy who could raise a cloud of dust on a clean sidewalk, in a snowstorm, or inside a building; and <a href="/Frieda_(Peanuts)" title="Frieda (Peanuts)">Frieda</a>, a girl proud of her &#34;naturally curly hair,&#34; and who owned a cat named <a href="/List_of_minor_characters_in_Peanuts#Faron" title="List of minor characters in Peanuts">Faron</a>, much to Snoopy&#39;s chagrin (the way Faron hung over Frieda&#39;s arms prompted Snoopy to comment that they had &#34;finally developed a boneless cat&#34;). Frieda eventually disappeared from the strip.</p>
<p><i>Peanuts</i> had several recurring characters that were actually absent from view. Some, such as the <a href="/The_Great_Pumpkin" title="The Great Pumpkin">Great Pumpkin</a> or <a href="/Manfred_von_Richthofen" title="Manfred von Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a> (the <a href="/Red_Baron" title="Red Baron">Red Baron</a>), were merely figments of the cast&#39;s imaginations. Others were not imaginary, such as the <a href="/Little_Red-Haired_Girl" title="Little Red-Haired Girl">Little Red-Haired Girl</a> (Charlie Brown&#39;s perennial dream girl who finally appeared in 1998, but only in silhouette), <a href="/Joe_Shlabotnik" title="Joe Shlabotnik">Joe Shlabotnik</a> (Charlie Brown&#39;s baseball hero), World War II (the vicious cat who lives next door to Snoopy—not to be confused with Frieda&#39;s cat, <a href="/List_of_minor_characters_in_Peanuts#Faron" title="List of minor characters in Peanuts">Faron</a>), and Charlie Brown&#39;s unnamed <a href="/Pen_pal" title="Pen pal">pen pal</a>, referred to as his &#34;pencil-pal&#34; after Charlie Brown&#39;s failed mastery of the fountain pen. Adult figures only appeared in the strip during a four-week Sunday-comic sequence in 1954 in which Lucy plays in an amateur golf tournament, with Charlie Brown &#34;coaching&#34; her. At no time, however, were any adult faces seen (it was also in this story that Lucy&#39;s family name, &#34;van Pelt&#34;, was first revealed.) There are adult voices in a few of the strips in its early years.</p>
<p>Schulz also added some fantastical characters, sometimes imbuing inanimate objects with sparks of life. Charlie Brown&#39;s nemesis, the <a href="/Kite-Eating_Tree" title="Kite-Eating Tree">Kite-Eating Tree</a>, is one example. Sally Brown&#39;s school building, that expressed thoughts and feelings about the students (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus&#39; famous &#34;<a href="/Security_blanket" title="Security blanket">security blanket</a>&#34; also displayed occasional signs of <a href="/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a>. Another example is Charlie Brown&#39;s pitching mound, which at times would express thoughts and opinions (&#34;Why don&#39;t you learn how to pitch, you stupid kid?&#34;).</p>

Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz&#39; retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on October 30, 2005, several comic strips again included references to <i>Peanuts</i>, and specifically the <i>It&#39;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</i> television special.</p>
<p>The December 1997 issue of <i>The Comics Journal</i> featured an extensive collection of testimonials to <i>Peanuts.</i> Over forty cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz&#39; art. <a href="/Gilbert_Hernandez" title="Gilbert Hernandez">Gilbert Hernandez</a> wrote &#34;<i>Peanuts</i> was and still is for me a revelation.

By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;&#34;&#39;Dear Sparky...&#39; Comic Artists From Across the Medium on the Legendary Cartoonist and Creator of Peanuts,&#34; The Comics Journal, December 1997&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Schulz was included in the touring exhibition &#34;Masters of American Comics&#34; based on his achievements in the art form while producing the strip. His gag work is hailed as being &#34;psychologically complex,&#34; and his style on the strip is noted as being &#34;perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;Masters&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Despite the widespread acclaim generated by <i>Peanuts</i> as a whole, some critics have alleged a decline in the strip&#39;s quality in the later years of its run, as Schulz frequently digressed from the more cerebral socio-psychological themes that characterized his earlier work in favor of lighter, more whimsical fare. For example, in an essay published in the <i><a href="/New_York_Press" title="New York Press">New York Press</a></i> at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, &#34;Against Snoopy,&#34; <a href="/Christopher_Caldwell" title="Christopher Caldwell">Christopher Caldwell</a> argued that the character of Snoopy, and the strip&#39;s increased focus on him in the 1970s, &#34;went from being the strip&#39;s besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;:0&#34;&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://nypress.com/against-snoopy/" rel="nofollow">http://nypress.com/against-snoopy/</a> |title=Against Snoopy |work=New York Press |first=Christopher |last=Caldwell |date=January 4, 2000}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In addition to the strip and numerous books, the <i>Peanuts</i> characters have appeared in animated form on television numerous times. This started when the <a href="/Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> licensed the characters in early 1959 for a series of color television commercials for its automobiles and intros for <i><a href="/The_Ford_Show" title="The Ford Show">The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show</a></i> which they sponsored. While the show ended in 1961, the deal lasted another three years. The ads were animated by <a href="/Bill_Mel%C3%A9ndez" title="Bill Meléndez">Bill Meléndez</a> for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. Schulz and Meléndez became friends, and when producer <a href="/Lee_Mendelson" title="Lee Mendelson">Lee Mendelson</a> decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called <i><a href="/A_Boy_Named_Charlie_Brown_(TV_special)" title="A Boy Named Charlie Brown (TV special)">A Boy Named Charlie Brown</a></i> in 1963, he brought on Meléndez for the project.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1965.E2.80.931971:_Television_specials_and_theatrical_films">1965–1971: Television specials and theatrical films</span></h3>
<p>Before the documentary was completed, the three of them (with help from their sponsor, the <a href="/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> Company) produced their first half-hour animated special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning <i><a href="/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas" title="A Charlie Brown Christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></i>, which was first aired on the <a href="/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> network on December 9, 1965. This episode is undoubtedly the most widely recognized of all <i>Peanuts</i> TV specials. This came after Coca-Cola asked Mendelson if he had a Christmas special. He said &#34;yes.&#34; The next day he called Schulz up and said they were making <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>.</p>
<p>The animated version of <i>Peanuts</i> differs in some aspects from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard, though conversations are usually only depicted from the children&#39;s end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, the sound of a <a href="/Trombone" title="Trombone">trombone</a> with a <a href="/Solotone_mute" title="Solotone mute">solotone mute</a> (created by <a href="/Vince_Guaraldi" title="Vince Guaraldi">Vince Guaraldi</a> {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} played by <a href="/Dean_Hubbard" title="Dean Hubbard">Dean Hubbard</a>  &#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="https://www.facebook.com/JustForBrass/posts/10151559984653746" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/JustForBrass/posts/10151559984653746</a> |title=Just for Brass - Music Fact of the Day: The noise of... |publisher=Facebook.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://trombone.org/trombone-l/archives/0002/000216.txt&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://trombone.org/trombone-l/archives/0002/000216.txt&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;) was used to simulate adult &#34;voices.&#34; A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy. In the strip, the dog&#39;s thoughts are verbalized in <a href="/Thought_balloon" title="Thought balloon">thought balloons</a>; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls or laughs (voiced by Bill Meléndez), and <a href="/Mime" title="Mime">pantomime</a>, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented with teacher dialogue in <i>She&#39;s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown</i>. The elimination of Snoopy&#39;s &#34;voice&#34; is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment. (, and later on occasion in the animated series <i><a href="/The_Charlie_Brown_and_Snoopy_Show" title="The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show">The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show</a></i>.)&#60;!--for whole paragraph--&#62;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
&#60;!--does not fit; unreferenced...Meléndez had some initial concerns about animating the Peanuts characters. They way Schulz designed them, they are limited in terms of mobility. Arms could only be raised so far, etc. Meléndez did not want to compromise the integrity of Schulz&#39; work, and found creative ways of resolving problems presented by their design.--&#62;
The success of <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> was the impetus for CBS to air many more prime-time <i>Peanuts</i> specials over the years, beginning with <i><a href="/Charlie_Brown&#39;s_All-Stars" title="Charlie Brown&#39;s All-Stars">Charlie Brown&#39;s All-Stars</a></i> and <i><a href="/It&#39;s_the_Great_Pumpkin%2C_Charlie_Brown" title="It&#39;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown">It&#39;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a></i> in 1966. In total, more than thirty animated specials were produced. Until his death in 1976, jazz pianist <a href="/Vince_Guaraldi" title="Vince Guaraldi">Vince Guaraldi</a> composed musical scores for the specials; in particular, the piece &#34;<a href="/Linus_and_Lucy" title="Linus and Lucy">Linus and Lucy</a>&#34; which has become popularly known as the signature theme song of the <i>Peanuts</i> franchise.
Schulz, Mendelson and Meléndez also collaborated on four theatrical feature films starring the characters, the first of which was <i><a href="/A_Boy_Named_Charlie_Brown" title="A Boy Named Charlie Brown">A Boy Named Charlie Brown</a></i> (1969). Most of these made use of material from Schulz&#39; strips, which were then adapted, although in other cases plots were developed around areas where there were minimal strips to reference.</p>

<p>The 1971 TV special <i><a href="/Play_It_Again%2C_Charlie_Brown" title="Play It Again, Charlie Brown">Play It Again, Charlie Brown</a></i> was the first time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which in this case was Chris Inglis. The characters voices were slightly deeper than usual.It would be like that for the rest of the TV specials.
In 1972, the second feature film <a href="/Snoopy_Come_Home" title="Snoopy Come Home">Snoopy Come Home</a> was released. This was the first time that Snoopy&#39;s thoughts were communicated to the audiences .The film&#39;s theme of loss made it have as much sadness as any animation centering on Charlie Brown. Snoopy and Charlie Brown&#39;s parting, Charlie Brown&#39;s inability to cope without his friend, and Snoopy&#39;s farewell to his former owner Lila are often pointed out as poignant moments in the history of Peanuts.
