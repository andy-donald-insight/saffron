<p>Granula was invented in Dansville, New York, by Dr. <a href="/James_Caleb_Jackson" title="James Caleb Jackson">James Caleb Jackson</a> at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863.{{cn|date=February 2015}} The Jackson Sanitarium was a prominent health spa that operated into the early 20th century on the hillside overlooking Dansville. It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson&#39;s cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company.

<p>A similar cereal was developed by John Harvey Kellogg. It too was initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.</p>
<p>The food and name were revived in the 1960s, and fruits and nuts were added to it to make it a <a href="/Health_food" title="Health food">health food</a> that was popular with the <a href="/Hippie" title="Hippie">hippie</a> movement. At the time, several people claim to have revived or re-invented granola. A major promoter was Layton Gentry, profiled in <i><a href="/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> as &#34;Johnny Granola-Seed&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;#CITEREF1972|Time 1972&#34;&#62;<a href="#CITEREF1972">Time 1972</a>&#60;/ref&#62; In 1964, Gentry sold the rights to a granola recipe using oats, which he claimed to have invented himself, to Sovex Natural Foods for $3,000. The company was founded in 1953 in <a href="/Holly%2C_Michigan" title="Holly, Michigan">Holly, Michigan</a> by the Hurlinger family with the main purpose of producing a concentrated paste of brewers <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> and <a href="/Soy_sauce" title="Soy sauce">soy sauce</a> known as &#34;Sovex&#34;. Earlier in 1964, it had been bought by John Goodbrad and moved to <a href="/Collegedale%2C_Tennessee" title="Collegedale, Tennessee">Collegedale, Tennessee</a>. In 1967, Gentry bought back the rights for west of the <a href="/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</a> for $1,500 and then sold the west coast rights to Wayne Schlotthauer of Lassen Foods in <a href="/Chico%2C_California" title="Chico, California">Chico, California</a>, for $18,000.&#60;ref name=&#34;#CITEREF1972|Time 1972&#34;/&#62; Lassen was founded from a health food bakery run by Schlotthauer&#39;s father-in-law.&#60;ref name=&#34;#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978&#34;&#62;<a href="#CITEREFKlein1978">Klein 1978</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The Hurlingers, Goodbrads, and Schlotthauers were all <a href="/Adventism" title="Adventism">Adventists</a>, and it is possible that Gentry was a lapsed Adventist who was familiar with the earlier granola.</p>
<p>In 1972, an executive at Pet Milk (later <a href="/Pet_Incorporated" title="Pet Incorporated">Pet Incorporated</a>) of <a href="/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, introduced Heartland Natural Cereal, the first major commercial granola.&#60;ref name=&#34;#CITEREFKlein1978|Klein 1978&#34;/&#62; At almost the same time, <a href="/Quaker_Oats_Company" title="Quaker Oats Company">Quaker</a> introduced Quaker 100% Natural Granola. Within a year, <a href="/Kellogg&#39;s" title="Kellogg&#39;s">Kellogg&#39;s</a> had introduced its &#34;Country Morning&#34; granola cereal and <a href="/General_Mills" title="General Mills">General Mills</a> had introduced its &#34;Nature Valley&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="#CITEREFBruceCrawford1995">Bruce 1995</a> p. 244&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 1974, McKee Baking (later <a href="/McKee_Foods" title="McKee Foods">McKee Foods</a>), makers of Little Debbie snack cakes, purchased Sovex.

&#34;Granola bars&#34; have become popular as a snack, similar to the traditional <a href="/Flapjack_(oat_bar)" title="Flapjack (oat bar)">flapjack (oat bar)</a> or muesli bar familiar in the Commonwealth countries. Granola bars consist of granola pressed and baked into a bar shape, resulting in the production of a more convenient snack. The product is most popular in the United States and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, parts of southern Europe, Brazil, Israel, South Africa and Japan. Recently, granola has begun to expand its market into India and other southeast Asian countries.</p>
