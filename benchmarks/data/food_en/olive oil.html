Archeological evidence shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC&#60;ref&#62;Ruth Schuster (December 17, 2014). &#34;8,000-year old olive oil found in Galilee, earliest known in world&#34;, <i>Haaretz</i>.

<p>The importance and antiquity of olive oil can be seen in the fact that the English word <i>oil</i> derives from c. 1175, <i>olive oil</i>, from Anglo-Fr. and O.N.Fr. <i>olie</i>, from O.Fr. <i>oile</i> (12c., Mod.Fr. <i>huile</i>), from L. <i>oleum</i> &#34;oil, olive oil&#34; (cf.

<p>
All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing. This paste is then <a href="/Malaxation" title="Malaxation">malaxed</a> (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or <a href="/Centrifuge" title="Centrifuge">centrifugation</a> (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called <a href="/Olive_mill_pomace" title="Olive mill pomace">pomace</a>, still contains a small quantity of oil.</p>
<p>The grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Virgin</i> means the oil was produced by the use of mechanical means only, with no chemical treatment. The term <i>virgin oil</i> with reference to production method includes all grades of virgin olive oil, including <i>Extra Virgin</i>, <i>Virgin</i>, <i>Ordinary Virgin</i> and <i>Lampante Virgin</i> olive oil products, depending on quality (see next section).</li>
<li><i>Lampante virgin oil</i> is olive oil extracted by virgin (mechanical) methods but not suitable for human consumption without further refining; <i>lampante</i> is Italian for &#34;glaring&#34;, referring to the earlier use of such oil for burning in lamps. Lampante virgin oil can be used for industrial purposes, or refined (see below) to make it edible.&#60;ref name=&#34;auto&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://aooa.com.au/quality-standards/olive-oil-grading/" rel="nofollow">http://aooa.com.au/quality-standards/olive-oil-grading/</a>|title=The 101 of olive oil designations and definitions.|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li><i>Refined Olive Oil</i> is the olive oil obtained from any grade of virgin olive oil by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. The refining process removes colour, odour and flavour from the olive oil, and leaves behind a very pure form of olive oil that is tasteless, colourless and odourless and extremely low in free fatty acids. Olive oils sold as the grades <i>extra-virgin olive oil</i> and <i>virgin olive oil</i> therefore cannot contain any refined oil.&#60;ref name=&#34;auto&#34;/&#62;</li>
<li><i>Crude Olive Pomace Oil</i> is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace (the leftover paste after the pressing of olives for virgin olive oils) with solvents or other physical treatments, to the exclusion of oils obtained by re-esterification processes and of any mixture with oils of other kinds.  It is then further refined into <i>Refined Olive Pomace Oil</i> and once re-blended with virgin olive oils for taste, is then known as <i>Olive Pomace Oil</i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;auto&#34;/&#62;</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Extra-virgin olive oil</b> Comes from virgin oil production only, and is of higher quality: among other things, it contains no more than 0.8% free acidity (see below), and is judged to have a superior taste, having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects. Extra-virgin olive oil accounts for less than 10% of oil in many producing countries; the percentage is far higher in the Mediterranean countries (Greece: 80%, Italy: 65%, Spain 50%).</li>
<li><b>Virgin olive oil</b> Comes from virgin oil production only, but is of slightly lower quality, with free acidity of up to 1.5%, and is judged to have a good taste, but may include some sensory defects.</li>
<li><b>Refined olive oil</b> is the olive oil obtained from virgin olive oils by refining methods that do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. It has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3&#38;nbsp;grams per 100&#38;nbsp;grams (0.3%) and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard. This is obtained by refining virgin olive oils with a high acidity level or organoleptic defects that are eliminated after refining. Note that no solvents have been used to extract the oil, but it has been refined with the use of charcoal and other chemical and physical filters. Oils labeled as <i>Pure olive oil</i> or <i>Olive oil</i> are primarily refined olive oil, with a small addition of virgin-production to give taste.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Olive_Pomace_Oil" title="Olive Pomace Oil">Olive pomace oil</a></b> is refined pomace olive oil often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, but may not be described simply as <i>olive oil</i>. It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it unfashionable among connoisseurs; however, it has the same fat composition as regular olive oil, giving it the same health benefits. It also has a high smoke point, and thus is widely used in restaurants as well as home cooking in some countries.</li>

<li><b>U.S. Virgin Olive Oil</b> for oil with reasonably good flavor and odor and free fatty acid content of not more than 2&#38;nbsp;g per 100&#38;nbsp;g (2%);</li>
<li><b>U.S. Virgin Olive Oil Not Fit For Human Consumption Without Further Processing</b> is a virgin (mechanically-extracted) olive oil of poor flavor and odor, equivalent to the IOC&#39;s <i>lampante</i> oil;</li>

{{Main|Olive oil extraction}}</p>
<p>Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid, so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional method) or steel drums (modern method).</li>
<li>If ground with mill stones, the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.</li>
<li>In modern steel drum mills the grinding process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.&#60;br /&#62;The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.</li>
<li>Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product. Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has <i>not</i> been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Unfiltered fresh olive oil that has a slightly cloudy appearance is called <a href="/Cloudy_olive_oil" title="Cloudy olive oil">cloudy olive oil</a>. This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming &#34;trendy&#34;, in line with consumer&#39;s demand for more ecological and less-processed &#34;green&#34; products.</li>
</ol>

<p>The remaining paste (pomace) still contains a small quantity (about 5–10%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialised chemical plants, not in the oil mills. The resulting oil is not &#34;virgin&#34; but &#34;pomace oil&#34;. The term &#34;first press&#34;, sometimes found on bottle labels, is today meaningless, as there is no &#34;second&#34; press; it comes from ancient times of stone presses, when virgin oil was the one produced by battering the olives.</p>
<p>The label term &#34;cold-extraction&#34; on extra virgin olive oils indicates that the olive grinding and stirring was done at a temperature of maximum {{Convert|25|C|F}}, as treatment in higher temperatures risks decreasing the olive oils&#39; quality (texture, taste and aroma).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web

<p>{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
Olive oil is the main <a href="/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">cooking oil</a> in countries surrounding the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a <a href="/Salad_dressing" title="Salad dressing">salad dressing</a> and as an ingredient in salad dressings. It is also used with foods to be eaten cold. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for <a href="/Saut%C3%A9ing" title="Sautéing">sautéing</a>.</p>
<p>The higher the temperature to which the olive oil is heated, the higher the risk of compromising its taste. When extra virgin olive oil is heated above {{convert|210|-|216|C|F|abbr=on}}, depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the oil are burned. This leads to deteriorated taste. Also, the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive oil is not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods. Refined olive oils are perfectly suited for <a href="/Deep_frying" title="Deep frying">deep frying</a> foods and should be replaced after several uses. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}</p>
<p>Choosing a cold-pressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a <a href="/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>. The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish. Also, people who like lots of <a href="/Tannin" title="Tannin">tannins</a> in their <a href="/Red_wine" title="Red wine">red wines</a> might prefer more bitter olive oils.</p>
<p>An important issue often not realized in countries that do not produce olive oil is that the freshness makes a big difference. A very fresh oil, as available in an oil producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere. In time, oils deteriorate and become stale. One-year-old oil may be still pleasant to the taste, but it is less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil should be used for cooking, not for foods to be eaten cold, like salads.</p>
<p>The taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors – riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil).</p>
<p>For certain culinary uses, olive oil may be replaced with <a href="/Safflower" title="Safflower">safflower</a> or <a href="/Sunflower_oil" title="Sunflower oil">sunflower oils</a>, <a href="/Canola_oil" title="Canola oil">canola oil</a>, <a href="/Peanut_oil" title="Peanut oil">peanut oil</a>, <a href="/Sesame_oil" title="Sesame oil">sesame oil</a>, or <a href="/Coconut_oil" title="Coconut oil">coconut oil</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://oilyoily.com/6-substitutes-for-olive-oil/" rel="nofollow">http://oilyoily.com/6-substitutes-for-olive-oil/</a>|title=6 Substitutes for Olive Oil|author=+Nastassia Green|work=Oilypedia.com – Benefits And Uses Of Supplemental and Essential Oils|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. A menorah similar to the Menorah used in the Mishkan is now used during the <a href="/Jewish_holiday" title="Jewish holiday">holiday</a> of <a href="/Hanukkah" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> that celebrates the miracle of the last of such containers being found during the re-dedication of the Temple (163 BC), when its contents lasted for far longer than they were expected to, allowing more time for more oil to be made. Although candles can be used to light the <a href="/Hanukkiah" title="Hanukkiah">hanukkiah</a>, oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original Menorah. Another use of oil in Jewish religion is for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel, originating from King David. <a href="/Tzidkiyahu" title="Tzidkiyahu">Tzidkiyahu</a> was the last anointed King of Israel.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Christianity">Christianity</span></h4>
<p>The Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the <a href="/Oil_of_Catechumens" title="Oil of Catechumens">Oil of Catechumens</a> (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for Baptism) and Oil of the Sick (used to confer the Sacrament of <a href="/Anointing_of_the_Sick" title="Anointing of the Sick">Anointing of the Sick</a> or <a href="/Unction" title="Unction">Unction</a>). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as <a href="/Balsam_of_Mecca" title="Balsam of Mecca">balsam</a> is <a href="/Consecrated" title="Consecrated">consecrated</a> by <a href="/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishops</a> as Sacred <a href="/Chrism" title="Chrism">Chrism</a>, which is used to confer the sacrament of <a href="/Confirmation_(sacrament)" title="Confirmation (sacrament)">Confirmation</a> (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of <a href="/Baptism" title="Baptism">Baptism</a> and the <a href="/Holy_Orders" title="Holy Orders">ordination</a> of <a href="/Priest" title="Priest">priests</a> and bishops, in the consecration of <a href="/Altar" title="Altar">altars</a> and <a href="/Church_(building)" title="Church (building)">churches</a>, and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their <a href="/Coronation" title="Coronation">coronation</a>. <a href="/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (Latter-day Saints) and a number of other religions use olive oil when they need to consecrate an oil for anointings.</p>
<p><a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Church, olive oil is a product not consumed during <a href="/Lent" title="Lent">lent</a> or <a href="/Penance" title="Penance">penance</a> while Orthodox <a href="/Monk" title="Monk">monks</a> use it sparingly in their diet. Exceptions are in feast days and Sundays.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Islam">Islam</span></h4>
<p>In Islam, <b>olive</b> oil is mentioned in the <a href="/Quran" title="Quran">Quranic</a> verse:</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;&#34;God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an <b>olive</b>, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! God guides to His Light whom He wills. And God sets forth parables for mankind, and God is All-Knower of everything.&#34; (سورة النور, An-Noor (The Light), Chapter #24, Verse #35)&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
