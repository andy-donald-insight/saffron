<p>{{Main|Weet-Bix#History|l1=History of Weet-Bix}}</p>
<p>Weetabix is the British version of the original Australian Weet-Bix.  Both Weet-Bix and Weetabix were invented by Bennison Osborne, an Australian.  Weet-Bix was introduced in Australia through the company “Grain Products Limited” in the mid-1920s, with funding from businessman Arthur Shannon and marketing assistance from Osborne’s New Zealand friend Malcolm Macfarlane.  To both Osborne’s and Macfarlane’s disappointment, Grain Products sold both its Australian company (in 1928) and then its New Zealand company (in 1930), to the <a href="/Sanitarium_Health_and_Wellbeing_Company" title="Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company">Sanitarium Health Foods Company</a>.  Osborne and Macfarlane then went to South Africa where Arthur Shannon, the owner of Grain Products, funded another Weet-Bix factory.  While in South Africa, Osborne modified his Weet-Bix recipe and with Macfarlane, obtained private funding and began the development of a new company, The British and African Cereal Company Limited, naming the new company&#39;s product, Weetabix.  The company commenced business in England in 1932 in an unused <a href="/Gristmill" title="Gristmill">gristmill</a> at <a href="/Burton_Latimer" title="Burton Latimer">Burton Latimer</a>, near <a href="/Kettering" title="Kettering">Kettering</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3DY9AAAAIAAJ&#38;pg=PA47&#38;dq=Weetabix&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=z59LTbO5EYfoOc3AxEE&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=2&#38;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&#38;q=Weetabix&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">Industrial history from the air</a> by Kenneth Hudson&#60;/ref&#62;  In 1936, the name of the company was changed to Weetabix Limited.</p>

<p>In British advertising in the 1980s, Weetabix anthropomorphized the biscuits, representing a group of &#39;street-wise&#39; young teens, beginning as &#39;skinheads&#39;. Their appearances on the packaging and associated publicity featured catch phrases such as &#34;titchy breakfast cereals&#34; to describe rivals, with the response &#34;Neet Weet Mate&#34;, &#34;OK!&#34;. The lead Weetabix was voiced by <a href="/Bob_Hoskins" title="Bob Hoskins">Bob Hoskins</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Chris Fillm (2002). &#34;Marketing Communications: Contexts, Strategies, and Applications&#34;. p. 516.
