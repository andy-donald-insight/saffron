<p>Introduced in 1953, the cereal has undergone several name changes. It started out as <b>Sugar Smacks</b>. In the 1980s, it was renamed <b>Honey Smacks</b>. In the early 1990s, perhaps because the product <a href="/Mascot" title="Mascot">mascot</a>, Dig&#39;em Frog, had customarily been portrayed as calling the cereal &#34;Smacks&#34;, the word &#34;Honey&#34; was dropped from the name and the product was then simply called <b>Smacks</b>. That name is still used in Germany,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.de/de_DE/smacks-consumer-brand.html" rel="nofollow">Kellogs Germany</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Spain,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.es/marcas/marcas_todas.php" rel="nofollow">Kellogs Spain</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Belgium,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.be/fr/produits/cereales/smacks/" rel="nofollow">Kelloggs Belgium</a>&#60;/ref&#62; the Netherlands,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.nl/nl/producten/ontbijtgranen/smacks/" rel="nofollow">Kelloggs Nederlands</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and France,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.fr/marques-kelloggs/produits-barres-cereales/smacks-r/63F2AF08-E74C-2EEC-04A8-C65423DF39BC" rel="nofollow">Kellogg&#39;s France</a>&#60;/ref&#62; where a box was featured in the film <i><a href="/Alphaville_(film)" title="Alphaville (film)">Alphaville</a></i>.

<p>In Australia, the cereal had been known as Honey Smacks since the 1970s. However, Kelloggs Australia no longer markets the brand.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.com.au/Home/Products/Cereal/tabid/316/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">List of Kelloggs Australia cereal products as of 2010</a>&#60;/ref&#62; GoldenVale currently markets this cereal under the name Honey Wheats with a bear and a honey bee as mascot.  In 2007, a minor consumer petition was launched calling for the re-instatement of the product.{{cn|date=April 2014}} Honey Smacks are no longer sold in Italy or Mexico either.</p>

<p>Ever since the cereal was introduced in 1953, there have been various different mascots.</p>
<p><b>Cliffy the Clown</b></p>
<p>Various <a href="/Clown" title="Clown">clowns</a> served as the advertising <a href="/Mascot" title="Mascot">mascot</a> from 1953 to 1956,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.food.pop-cult.com/imagepages/image19.html" rel="nofollow">Clown box of Sugar Smacks</a>&#60;/ref&#62; including <a href="/Cliffy_the_Clown" title="Cliffy the Clown">Cliffy the Clown</a>. Ads with these clowns were known for showing them do the &#34;Sugar Smack Swing&#34;. </p>
<p><b>Smaxey the Seal</b></p>
<p>In 1957, a sailor-suit-wearing <a href="/Pinniped" title="Pinniped">seal</a> named Smaxey became the mascot. </p>
<p><b>Quick Draw McGraw</b></p>
<p>The <a href="/Cartoon_Network_Studios" title="Cartoon Network Studios">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoon horse <a href="/Sheriff" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a>, <a href="/Quick_Draw_McGraw" title="Quick Draw McGraw">Quick Draw McGraw</a>, took over in 1961. </p>
<p><b>The Smackin&#39; Bandit</b></p>
<p>In 1965, the mascot became The Smackin&#39; Bandit, a half-<a href="/Mule" title="Mule">mule</a>, half-<a href="/Kangaroo" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a> who kissed everyone in sight. </p>
<p><b>The Smackin&#39; Brothers</b></p>
<p>The Smackin&#39; Bandit was replaced in 1966 by the Smackin&#39; Brothers, two boys dressed in boxing shorts and boxing gloves. These ads usually featured the brothers wanting Sugar Smacks but wind up smacking each other instead. Also during 1966, promotional box designs were briefly introduced featuring characters from <i><a href="/Star_Trek" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.onedigitallife.com/2009/04/13/space-energy-comes-from-sugar-smacks/" rel="nofollow">Mr. Spock featuring on a Sugar Smacks box</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Later commercials were similar to most <a href="/Cheerios" title="Cheerios">Cheerios</a> commercials as they demonstrated how the cereal was &#34;vitamin-powered&#34;. <a href="/Paul_Frees" title="Paul Frees">Paul Frees</a> narrated these ads.</p>
<p><b>Dig&#39;em Frog</b></p>
<p>In the early 1970s, an Indian Chief appeared briefly, replaced by Dig&#39;em Frog in 1972.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.fr/marques-kelloggs/produits-barres-cereales/smacks-r/63F2AF08-E74C-2EEC-04A8-C65423DF39BC" rel="nofollow">Dig&#39;em history in French</a>&#60;/ref&#62; He continued as spokesfrog when the cereal was rechristened Honey Smacks in the early 1980s. In these ads, Dig&#39;em would appear in front of a group of kids, and they would have some cereal together.</p>
<p><b>Love Smacks</b></p>
<p>This character was a loveable heart shaped dog, which was featured in 1982 giving hugs to children.</p>
<p><b>Wally the Bear</b></p>
<p>Dig &#39;em was replaced by an animal more associated with <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>, Wally the Bear, in 1986 (1984 in France&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kelloggs.fr/marques-kelloggs/produits-barres-cereales/smacks-r/63F2AF08-E74C-2EEC-04A8-C65423DF39BC" rel="nofollow">Kellogg&#39;s France site</a>&#60;/ref&#62;). These ads would feature Wally (not to be confused with the Wally Bear from <i><a href="/Wally_Bear_and_the_NO!_Gang" title="Wally Bear and the NO! Gang">Wally Bear and the NO! Gang</a></i>) pestering a kid eating a bowl of Honey Smacks and doing anything to get some, and the kid would always refuse or just ignore Wally completely. These commercials didn&#39;t do too well since they seemed too much like the <a href="/Trix_(cereal)" title="Trix (cereal)">Trix</a> commercials, plus Wally was not a very attractive character, and Dig&#39;em Frog was brought back the following year by popular demand. </p>
<p><b>Dig&#39;em Frog (redux)</b></p>
<p>During the 1990s, advertising campaigns for the cereal featured Dig&#39;em attempting to have a bowl of Smacks while trying to outsmart his nemesis, Kitty.  By 1997, these commercials were discontinued. Dig&#39;em&#39;s voice was provided by <a href="/Len_Dresslar" title="Len Dresslar">Len Dresslar</a> and for present the character is voiced in commercials by <a href="/Frank_Welker" title="Frank Welker">Frank Welker</a>.  While ads for Honey Smacks don&#39;t air in the US as of lately, more recent ads in other countries depict Dig&#39;em as a character who&#39;s crazily addicted to Smacks.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the cereal was promoted with the character <b>Barney Bee</b> and rivaled <a href="/Quaker_Oats_Company" title="Quaker Oats Company">Quaker</a>&#39;s <a href="/Sugar_Puffs" title="Sugar Puffs">Sugar Puffs</a> brand. However, due to Sugar Puffs&#39; long established popularity, &#34;Puffa Wheats&#34;, as they are now called, are only available in <a href="/Poundland" title="Poundland">Poundland</a> or other Pound stores in the United Kingdom.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}</p>
<p>In France, the cereal was called &#34;Smacks&#34; with a box featuring prominently in <a href="/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>&#39;s 1965 film <i><a href="/Alphaville_(film)" title="Alphaville (film)">Alphaville</a></i>.</p>
