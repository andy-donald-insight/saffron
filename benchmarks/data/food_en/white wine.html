<p><b>White wine</b> is a <a href="/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a> whose <a href="/Wine_color" title="Wine color">color</a> can be straw-<a href="/Yellow" title="Yellow">yellow</a>, yellow-<a href="/Green" title="Green">green</a>, or yellow-<a href="/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a> coloured.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Characterize Types of White Wine by Color|url=<a class="external free" href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/white-wines-by-color/" rel="nofollow">http://winefolly.com/tutorial/white-wines-by-color/</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>It is produced by the <a href="/Alcoholic_fermentation" title="Alcoholic fermentation">alcoholic fermentation</a> of the non-colored <a href="/Juice_vesicles" title="Juice vesicles">pulp</a> of <a href="/Grapes" title="Grapes">grapes</a> which may have a white or black skin. It is treated so as to maintain a yellow transparent color in the final product. The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varieties</a>, methods of <a href="/Winemaking" title="Winemaking">winemaking</a>, and also the ratio of <a href="/Residual_sugar" title="Residual sugar">residual sugar</a>.</p>
<p>White wine has existed for at least 2500 years. It has accompanied economic development and colonized every country whose inhabitants are wine drinkers: Europe, America, Oceania, although less systematically in Africa and Asia due to climate and religious reasons.</p>
<p>The white grapes from which white wine is mainly produced are green or yellow of which there are many so that white wine can be produced anywhere that grapes can be grown. Some varieties are well-known such as the <a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">Chardonnay</a>, <a href="/Sauvignon_blanc" title="Sauvignon blanc">Sauvignon</a>, and <a href="/Riesling" title="Riesling">Riesling</a>. Others have a discrete existence hidden behind the name of a wine resulting from the assembly of several varieties. <a href="/Tokay_(grape)" title="Tokay (grape)">Tokay</a>, <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">Sherry</a>, and <a href="/Sauternes_(wine)" title="Sauternes (wine)">Sauternes</a> are examples of these. The winemaker can also use a variety with a coloured skin provided one is careful not to stain the <a href="/Wort" title="Wort">wort</a> during the separation of the pulp-juice. The <a href="/Pinot_noir" title="Pinot noir">Pinot noir</a>, for example, is commonly used to produce <a href="/Champagne" title="Champagne">champagne</a>.</p>
<p>Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived from the complete fermentation of the <a href="/Wort" title="Wort">wort</a>. Sweet wines, whether <i>moelleux</i> (Sweet: 12-45 g/l of sugar) or <i>liquoreux</i> (Fortified: &#62;45 g/l sugar) wines are where the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol: this is called <i>Mutage</i> or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, <i>passerillage</i> (straining), or the use of <i><a href="/Noble_rot" title="Noble rot">Noble rot</a></i>. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are wines where the <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened giving a delicate foam beverage considered the festive wine <i>par excellence</i>.</p>
<p>Celebrated by writers, poets, singers and painters, white wine is used as an <i><a href="/Ap%C3%A9ritif_and_digestif" title="Apéritif and digestif">Apéritif</a></i> during the meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. They are more refreshing, lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts, making them ideal for spring and summer occasions. The old guideline of “white wine with white meat” still holds true in many instances, but there are plenty of exceptions and palate preferences that dictate which wines to pair with what foods. As an example, Chardonnay combines well with the taste of <i>fleur de lis</i> (triple cream cheese).</p>
<p>White wine also contributes to the development of dishes in the kitchen thanks to its acidity, aroma, and its ability to soften meat and deglaze the cooking juices. Its benefits to the body are however lower than those attributed to red wine because it is low in polyphenolic compounds.</p>

<p>In <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> wine had already been developed and used since <a href="/Hippocrates" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>, a physician born around 460 BC who commonly prescribed it to patients. &#34;Vinous white wine&#34; and &#34;bitter white wine&#34; were used&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;46&#60;/ref&#62; among his remedies - a sign of diversity in production at that time.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Roman_times" title="Roman times">Roman times</a> the type of viticulture practiced by the Greeks was their model for a long time and production included white wine. Rich Roman <a href="/Patrician_(ancient_Rome)" title="Patrician (ancient Rome)">patricians</a> organized banquets where the cost of the food was a sign of prestige. In the range of expensive products wine played a predominant role. The richest citizens built sumptuous villas in the <a href="/Bay_of_Naples" title="Bay of Naples">Bay of Naples</a> where the vine had been cultivated since its introduction by the Greeks.

It also encouraged them to seek new wild varieties adaptable to these distant areas where the Mediterranean varieties showed their limits. For example, vines were planted on the banks of the <a href="/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> to provide the <a href="/Roman_legion" title="Roman legion">Legions</a> with a healthy drink as opposed to water which was rarely drinkable.

The wine trade between the eastern Mediterranean and northern Europe fell sharply.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;171&#60;/ref&#62; At the same time, the <a href="/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish</a> had just completed their <i><a href="/Reconquista" title="Reconquista">Reconquista</a></i> and replaced the Mediterranean wine with its own, especially for English and Dutch consumers. The port of <a href="/Sanlucar_de_Barrameda" title="Sanlucar de Barrameda">Sanlucar de Barrameda</a> began to export large quantities of white wine which was the ancestor of today&#39;s <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">sherry</a>. This wine was called <i>sack</i> and caused a sensation in England. Even at the height of animosity between the two countries (as in the episode of the <a href="/Spanish_Armada" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588) the trade continued - sometimes provided by pirates who stole what they could not buy.

<p>The <a href="/Little_Ice_Age" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a> spelt the death knell of northern viticulture.

<p>The enrichment of some of the population created a craze for rare wines. This phenomenon, which was already responsible for the development of <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">sherry</a> in England, was reproduced in Central Europe. The discovery of the benefits of the <a href="/Noble_rot" title="Noble rot">noble rot</a> on white grapes took place around 1650&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;232&#60;/ref&#62; in <a href="/Hungarian_wine" title="Hungarian wine">Hungary</a> for the development of <a href="/Tokaji" title="Tokaji">Tokaji</a> wine. <a href="/Hugh_Johnson_(wine_writer)" title="Hugh Johnson (wine writer)">Hugh Johnson</a> declared that: &#34;the Tokay of three centuries ago was the best sweet wine in the world, it was inherited from a long-standing winemaking tradition&#34;.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;235&#60;/ref&#62; Developed with a grape whose exceptional maturity is due to a trade secret, this wine is also developed its qualities through a process which long remained a secret in underground cellars of the winery. Prized by the <a href="/House_of_Habsburg" title="House of Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a>, Tokay experienced profitable trading. Attempted imitation came to nought and the use of noble rot remained a secret. It was not until 120 years later that a method of very late harvest was experimented with on the steep banks of the <a href="/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>. Its use in <a href="/Sauternes_(wine)" title="Sauternes (wine)">Sauternes</a> was attested in 1836 in the <a href="/Ch%C3%A2teau_La_Tour_Blanche" title="Château La Tour Blanche">Château La Tour Blanche</a> but at that time very late harvest gave a very rich wine that required several years to age in barrels.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;264&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Other regions were discovering secrets which would make them rich. So it was that <a href="/Dom_P%C3%A9rignon_(monk)" title="Dom Pérignon (monk)">Dom Perignon</a> was the legendary creator of champagne.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;210&#60;/ref&#62; In a northern vineyard he developed a special wine that would give rise to an exceptional passion for wine produced in a climate where it could not be expected for wine to reach maturity nor sufficient colour.</p>
<p>The fashion of drinking cheap dry white wine started in Paris in the 18th century: to evade the excise duty the Parisians took the habit of going to drink their wine at the producers premises outside the walls of the city. <a href="/Cabaret" title="Cabaret">Cabarets</a> opened their doors by the river, becoming <a href="/Guinguette" title="Guinguette">Guinguettes</a> (similar to taverns): so the wine that was drunk there was also called &#34;guinguet&#34;. This is a wine from the hills of the <a href="/Seine" title="Seine">Seine</a> or the <a href="/Marne_(river)" title="Marne (river)">Marne</a>, sour, but the conditions of transport of the time did not allow it to be used prematurely.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://segolene.ampelogos.com/news/cabarets-et-guinguettes" rel="nofollow"><i>Cabarets and guinguettes</i></a>, Boire et manger, quelle histoire!, consulted on 20 March 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p><a href="/Champagne" title="Champagne">Champagne</a> was created in the 18th century but it was in the next century that its global expansion would occur. The crowned heads of Europe quickly made the wine stylish in their courts although its production, necessarily in bottles, made a very expensive product. Hugh Johnson&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;331&#60;/ref&#62; assigns an important diplomatic role to champagne: <a href="/Talleyrand" title="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a> would have offered this wine at the negotiating table of the <a href="/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>, using it to relax his partners in the discussions. The occupation of <a href="/Champagne_(wine_region)" title="Champagne (wine region)">Champagne</a> by Russian troops in 1815 publicized the sparkling wine to the Russian aristocracy. The <i><a href="/Madame_Clicquot_Ponsardin" title="Madame Clicquot Ponsardin">Veuve Clicquot</a></i> (Widow Clicquot) booked her wine to her occupants saying &#34;they drink today, tomorrow they will pay...&#34;&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;335&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The progress of the glass industry (especially from the use of coal) helped to democratize the use of the glass bottle. The production of sparkling wine increased dramatically and spread to the American continent. The technique of manufacturing was industrialized and other regions were inspired but the reputation of champagne suffered. The commercial flight of champagne was a product of the industrial revolution that allowed it to be within the financial reach of the booking middle classes.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;339&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The period of the 19th century before the arrival of <a href="/Phylloxera" title="Phylloxera">phylloxera</a> was a golden age of wine. The industrial revolution enriched a bourgeoisie clientele for the best wines and the rural exodus to the factories created a large market for mass-produced wines. A prominent example for white wines was the <a href="/German_wine" title="German wine">viticulture in Germany</a>. The feeling of freedom infused into the German winemakers under French occupation during the <a href="/French_First_Empire" title="French First Empire">First Empire</a> prevented the aristocracy and the clergy from recovering all the vineyards from which they were dispossessed.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;395&#60;/ref&#62; The practice of late harvest was widespread and the more or less sweet wines gained balance against their always lively acidity. In 1872 the <a href="/Geisenheim_Grape_Breeding_Institute" title="Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute">Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute</a> was created and it was the source of a great amount of interbreeding giving new varieties - the best known of these is the <a href="/M%C3%BCller-Thurgau" title="Müller-Thurgau">Müller-Thurgau</a>.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;396&#60;/ref&#62; During the same period, <a href="/Swiss_wine" title="Swiss wine">Switzerland</a> adopted, along the shores of <a href="/Lake_Geneva" title="Lake Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>, vineyards predominantly producing white wine.</p>
<p>During the 20th century planting vines in countries where it was unknown was booming. However, it was shaky  in places with higher temperatures during fermentation.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;450&#60;/ref&#62; The use of larger containers creates problems of fermentation: the yeasts produce heat which cannot escape and beyond 35&#38;nbsp;°C  the micro-organisms begin to suffer and fermentation slows then stops. After cooling the wine a new addition of yeast is needed to resume fermentation (not to mention the adverse effects on the wine&#39;s aromas and the risk of <i>lactic bite</i>). In California the search for temperature control of fermentation matured. Applied to white wine they revolutionized this type of wine. European wines, marked by their processes of crushing the grapes&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;397&#60;/ref&#62; are diametrically opposed to those very fruity wines marked by a refreshing liveliness. During the years 1960-1990, these methods of wine-making moved to Europe and the use of refrigeration equipment is now widely used in almost all regions producing white wine.</p>

<p>Many wine-producing countries produce white wine, however the white grape needs less heat than red grapes to ripen: the lack of maturity of <a href="/Tannin_(wine)" title="Tannin (wine)">tannins</a> is not a problem since they are not extracted in pressing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Grape_varieties">Grape varieties</span></h2>
<p>Numerous <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varieties</a> of grapes can be used to develop white wine.</p>
<p>Some have achieved a strong reputation thanks to their marketing of a wine variety:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">Chardonnay</a> B</b>:&#60;ref group=&#34;N&#34;&#62;The International code designating the variety indicates the colour of the grape:: B = white (blanc), N = black (noir), Rs = rose, G = grey.&#60;/ref&#62; originating from <a href="/Burgundy_wine" title="Burgundy wine">Burgundy</a>  and long sold under that name under the communal AOC or <a href="/Cru_(wine)" title="Cru (wine)">premier and grand crus</a>, it has spread to many new producing countries who sell under the name of the grape. It can be made sparkling or still. It typically has a wider-bodied and rich citrus taste compared to other white wines. A common choice of food pairing for this wine is fish or poultry. It owes its world distribution to its quality in a very wide variety of regions of climate and geology: from <a href="/French_wine" title="French wine">France</a> to the <a href="/American_wine" title="American wine">United States</a>, <a href="/Australian_wine" title="Australian wine">Australia</a>, and <a href="/South_African_wine" title="South African wine">South Africa</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.chardonnay-du-monde.com/Fr/80_chard/index.fr.html" rel="nofollow"><i>The success of Chardonnay in the world, a subject for thought</i></a><i>, Chardonnay du monde, consulted on 2 March 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</i></li>

It is remarkable for its typical vegetable/mineral aromas&#60;ref group=&#34;a&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;230-231.&#60;/ref&#62; so tends to be flat and lack fruit qualities. The dominating flavours range from sour green fruit such as of apple, pear and gooseberry through to tropical fruit such as melon, mango and blackcurrant. A common food pairing for this wine is seafood, poultry, and salad.</li>

<p>Grape maturity depends on the requirement of the final product. For a sweet white wine, whether fortified or natural, sugar is the key criterion. For a dry white wine, technological maturity is calculated and the fruit is harvested just before (usually eight days&#60;ref name=&#34;berger&#34;&#62;<i>The Procedures of Winemaking</i>,   Science &#38; Vie, No. 155, quarterly series, Jean-Luc Berger, September 1986, Éditions Exelsior, Paris, ISSN 0151 0282, pages 76-77, {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;) the maturity of the sugar. At this point the relationship between sugar and acid is optimal. Further, low acidity will cause the future wine to be unbalanced with excess alcohol and lack of liveliness. In addition, the flavour will be less fresh and less vivid.</p>

<p>The first step in processing the grapes at the winery is to separate the components of the <a href="/Wort" title="Wort">wort</a> that are needed from the unwanted parts.&#60;ref name=&#34;berger&#34;/&#62; The process followed at this stage will largely determine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured <a href="/Must" title="Must">must</a>). The practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine a herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent yellow colour is retained.</p>
<p>The winemaker can soak the skins of white grapes and practice <a href="/Maceration_(wine)" title="Maceration (wine)">maceration</a> if the quality of the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed at a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation.

Acidity decreases as does the ratio of <a href="/Colloid" title="Colloid">Colloids</a> (large <a href="/Pectin" title="Pectin">pectin</a> type molecules) and aging potential.

<p>The wort is then placed in a tank to undergo fermentation. These fermentation tanks can be of several types: oak, cement coated with <a href="/Epoxy" title="Epoxy">epoxy</a>, stainless or enamelled <a href="/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a>, or epoxy resin.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sopexa19&#34;&#62;Sopexa, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 19.&#60;/ref&#62; For large volume tanks the control of temperature, which typically is around 18&#38;nbsp;°C,&#60;ref name=&#34;dubourdieu&#34;/&#62; becomes necessary. The majority of aromatic components (acetates of alcohol and ethyl <a href="/Esters" title="Esters">esters</a> of fatty acids) are synthesized by the yeast during fermentation of light juice below 18&#38;nbsp;°C. However, clarity and low temperatures are factors which slow fermentation.&#60;ref name=&#34;berger&#34;/&#62; Recourse to the addition of selected yeasts for these difficult working conditions becomes crucial.&#60;ref name=&#34;dubourdieu&#34;/&#62; In contrast some producers grow their vines organically or biodynamically: the lees are of good quality without synthetic chemicals harmful to yeast so they are kept in the wine. Turbidity of the must ensures a good supply of yeasts and fermentation in small tanks or in barrels then does not require mastery of cold.</p>
<p>Fermentation starts spontaneously under the action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The winemaker can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the <a href="/Lees_(fermentation)" title="Lees (fermentation)">lees</a>. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20&#38;nbsp;°C or even 25&#38;nbsp;°C.&#60;ref name=&#34;dubourdieu&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>After the end of fermentation, the wine may also have <a href="/Malolactic_fermentation" title="Malolactic fermentation">malolactic fermentation</a> or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the <a href="/Malic_acid" title="Malic acid">malic acid</a>, which has two <a href="/Carboxyl_group" title="Carboxyl group">carboxyl groups</a>, into <a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing <a href="/Aroma_of_wine" title="Aroma of wine">Aroma of wine</a>. During the fermentation of the grapes <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varietal</a> aromas are reduced in favour of an increase in roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.&#60;ref name=&#34;dubourdieu&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>For a sweet wine, fermentation is stopped before its end to keep some of the sugar: this is the <i>Mutage</i> (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding <a href="/Sulphur_Dioxide" title="Sulphur Dioxide">Sulphur Dioxide</a> (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), or a combination of several of these methods.&#60;ref name=&#34;dubourdieu&#34;/&#62; A rule of thumb for determining the point of <i>mutage</i>, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume.&#60;ref group=&#34;N&#34;&#62;For example: for a must with a potential measure of 16% vol, the mutage will be when the fermentation produces 13% vol of alcohol and there will remain 3% vol potential in the form of sugar: so 3 × 16.83 = 50gms of sugar L to the power of -1&#60;/ref&#62; For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.</p>
<p>A winemaking technique called &#34;reducing&#34; or &#34;technology&#34; has been developed. Very fashionable in Australia and New Zealand, this technique seeks highly aromatic white wines and is very interesting on aromatic varieties such as Sauvignon B, Colombard B, and Riesling B, although less so for varieties such as Chardonnay B. It works by limiting <a href="/Premature_oxidation" title="Premature oxidation">Premature oxidation</a> in the must or the wine at all stages of development. The use of inert gases such as <a href="/Carbon_Dioxide" title="Carbon Dioxide">Carbon Dioxide</a> (CO2) isolates the grapes from oxygen from the air and cold partially inhibits the action of oxidative enzymes in the must. <a href="/Tyrosinase" title="Tyrosinase">Tyrosinase</a>, a natural enzyme in the grape, and <a href="/Laccase" title="Laccase">laccase</a>, an enzyme coming from the <i>gray mold</i> are very active in oxidation. Laccase can be eliminated by sorting the grapes. Strong limitation on the amount of <a href="/Polyphenol" title="Polyphenol">polyphenols</a> in the wine by reducing the time between harvest and pressing is another technique that aims to make a very light wine, protected from yellowing.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.vignevin-sudouest.com/publications/fiches-pratiques/vinification-vins-blancs-conditions-reductrices.php" rel="nofollow"><i>Making white wine in reduced conditions</i></a>, Institut français de la vigne et du vin, consulted on 31 December 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>After fermentation all wine requires constant care to be fit for consumption. All of these practices before bottling are known as <i>élevage</i> or <a href="/Aging_of_wine" title="Aging of wine">Maturing</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;oenologie&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.oenologie.fr/oenologie/elevage/elevageintro.shtml" rel="nofollow"><i>What is élevage</i></a>,  Œnologie.fr, consulted on 4 June 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Maturing">Maturing</span></h3>
<p>Maturing can be done in a vat. It takes little time to clarify and to prepare the packaging (<a href="/Bottling" title="Bottling">bottling</a> or <a href="/Bag-In-Box" title="Bag-In-Box">Bag-In-Box</a>) but this may be extended by maturing of <a href="/Lees_(fermentation)" title="Lees (fermentation)">lees</a>. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which digests itself (<a href="/Autolysis_(biology)" title="Autolysis (biology)">autolysis</a>) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called <i>Bâtonnage</i> or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees at the bottom of the barrel.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cavesa.ch/definition/batonnage,1152.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Definition: bâtonnage</i></a>, Club des amateurs de vins exquis, consulted on 9 January 2011 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a <i>Goût de réduit</i> (Reduced taste) due to the activity of <a href="/Reductase" title="Reductase">reductase</a> <a href="/Sulphite" title="Sulphite">sulphite</a> from the yeast.&#60;ref name=Maturing&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.vignevin-sudouest.com/publications/compte-rendus-recherche/compte-rendu.php?id=10" rel="nofollow"><i>Maturing of white wines with lees</i></a>, Institut français de la vigne et du vin, vignevin-sudouest.com, consulted on 6 June 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; This operation can be done in vats, as in <a href="/Muscadet" title="Muscadet">Muscadet</a>, barrels as in <a href="/Burgundy_wine" title="Burgundy wine">Burgundy</a> and many <a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">chardonnays</a>, or bottles as in <a href="/Champagne" title="Champagne">champagne</a>.&#60;ref name=Maturing/&#62;</p>
<p>Maturing can also be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after fermentation but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but it also helps to mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize the components of the wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.</p>

<p>Clarification consists of removing insoluble particles in suspension in the water-alcohol solution that is the wine and stabilization is to maintain the solubility of the elements dissolved in the wine throughout the retention period in the bottle and consumption at the table.</p>
<p>To clarify wine, it is necessary to wait for particle deposition at the bottom of the wine container but this can be accelerated by the use of oenological adhesives. These additives bind to the insoluble particles and fall to the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="/Tannic_acid" title="Tannic acid">Tannic acid</a> (or gallotannic) C76-H52-O46 is used for the clarification of white wine, using <a href="/Casein" title="Casein">casein</a>, <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a>, or <a href="/Isinglass" title="Isinglass">Isinglass</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stabilisation">Stabilisation</span></h3>
<p>The majority of wine components are dissolved in the wine: certain components, however, may take an insoluble form during ageing or storage of wine - this is the case with <a href="/Tartaric_acid" title="Tartaric acid">tartaric acid</a>. A salt containing potassium, <a href="/Potassium_bitartrate" title="Potassium bitartrate">potassium bitartrate</a> is in the form of crystals at the bottom of the bottle. This is a natural phenomenon but many producers seek to avoid this as dealers and uninformed consumers take these crystals as a fault. It is caused or accelerated by cold storage: low temperature reduces its solubility. The habit of refreshing white wine makes this wine particularly sensitive to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Several solutions are available to stabilize the wine:</p>
<p>The first is to cool the wine to a negative temperature near freezing for several weeks.&#60;ref group=&#34;N&#34;&#62;The freezing temperature of wine is approximately half of its alcohol content by volume, expressed as a negative value. For example, a wine of 10% by volume freezes around –5°C, a wine of 12% by volume at around –6°C&#60;/ref&#62; The potassium bitartrate crystals precipitate and can be removed by filtration prior to packaging in bottles or bag-in-boxes. This solution is costly in refrigeration energy and can negatively affect the <a href="/Organoleptic" title="Organoleptic">organoleptic</a> qualities of the wine.</p>
<p>Another solution is to introduce Metatartaric acid, a tartaric acid polymer, into the wine. Its mode of action is still unknown but it prevents microscopic crystals from growing. However, the effect is not sustainable in the long term (between 6 and 18 months) because it hydrolyzes when warm.</p>
<p>A third way is <a href="/Electrodialysis" title="Electrodialysis">electrodialysis</a>: an electric current between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially <a href="/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> which is responsible for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast (mannoproteins) allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy and refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&#38;q=cache:Gr5RNIm9tXkJ:www.bordeaux-expo.com/vinitech/chine/pdf_center/stabilisation_precip_tartriq.pdf+acide+m%C3%A9tatartrique&#38;hl=fr&#38;gl=fr&#38;pid=bl&#38;srcid=ADGEESgpcIvVf4nPaLjh3N6USls6SyFk5X0SELK4DU28Dc1YYE84Lk6qtZ-BDAUUmvXMmzY-d9-lk6V_yh0yPWJ9j8lIkmjGYEVvUmBrQ8aZxMARoPv2XxXx7WV0hdgSjSTfB0Pfw2e_&#38;sig=AHIEtbTyGWIOaH2MO_eLNSMemQwpp1yvcA" rel="nofollow">Conference on the stabilisation of tartaric precipitations</a>, Virginie Moine-Ledoux, Denis Dubourdieu and Dominique Trioné; 2005, Salon Vinitech, at <a href="/Qingdao" title="Qingdao">Qingdao</a> (China), consulted on 10 June 2010

<p>Some producers who sell their own products directly to the consumer, explain these natural phenomena to the customer who then serve the wine gently in order to prevent the crystals forming in the bottom of the bottle.</p>
<p>The presence of unstable proteins that can create a visual problem (protein breakdown) in the wine also requires stabilization. Treatment with <a href="/Bentonite" title="Bentonite">bentonite</a> allows the precipitation of unstable proteins which can then be removed by filtration and extraction.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.vignevin.com/recherche/vin-et-marche/maitrise-des-intrants-en-oenologie/stabilite-proteique/interet-pour-la-filiere.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Protein stability and treatment by bentonite of dry white wines and rosés</i></a>, Eric Meistermann, Institut français de la vigne et du vin, consulted on 18 August 2013 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; The proteins can also react with Metatartaric acid added to wine to prevent tartaric precipitation: the wine then loses its shine and becomes opalescent like <a href="/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a>. Some <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varieties</a> are naturally high in protein (muscat. ..) but levels also vary depending on the vintage and maturity levels.</p>
<p>Finally some white wines can be victims of <i>Rosissement</i> (pinking).

<p>The maximum allowable doses depend on the sugar content of the wine: the residual sugar is susceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Filtration_and_conditioning">Filtration and conditioning</span></h3>

<p>Packaging is the operation to put the wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement to the quality of the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from <a href="/Tetra_Pak" title="Tetra Pak">Tetra Pak</a>, the bottle of <a href="/Polyethylene_terephthalate" title="Polyethylene terephthalate">polyethylene terephthalate</a> or PET, the <a href="/Beverage_can" title="Beverage can">beverage can</a>, and the <a href="/Bag-In-Box" title="Bag-In-Box">Bag-In-Box</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Colour">Colour</span></h3>
<p>The colour of white wine is as varied as the types of wines. The term most commonly cited is yellow. However, the richness of vocabulary leaves free space for visual analysis between the actual colour and the hue (the range of colour is often different at the joint between the wine and the glass).</p>
<p>At the end of the 20th century the components of the wine which made the colour were still not clearly identified. Over the ages the <i>flavones</i> in the grapes were considered responsible for the yellow colour but their very low dissolution in wine, due to short <a href="/Maceration_(wine)" title="Maceration (wine)">maceration</a>, led to a search for other molecules. A thesis by Biau in 1995&#60;ref name=&#34;peynaud&#34;&#62;<a href="/%C3%89mile_Peynaud" title="Émile Peynaud">Émile Peynaud</a> and Jacques Blouin, <i>The taste of Wine: the great book of taste</i>, Dunod, Paris, 2006, 237 pages, p. 159-161, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2100495984" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2100495984">ISBN 2-10-049598-4</a> {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;  alluded to the influence of polysaccharides, proteins, and some phenolic acids.</p>
<p>Léglise specified that: &#34;the term <i>gold</i> is used if the appearance is very bright and full of reflections, in the definition of the various nuances specific to the metal (...) If, with proper clarity, the wine does not shed light and does not radiate reflection, we will give only the term yellow&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;peynaud&#34;/&#62; On a colour scale white wine can be almost colourless white. When young it usually takes on a pale greenish or pale yellow tint. Its yellow colour darkens with age and maturing becoming gold, then copper, and finally amber. One of the darkest wines in the world is achieved with a white grape: the <i><a href="/Pedro_Ximenez" title="Pedro Ximenez">Pedro Ximenez</a></i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;peynaud&#34;/&#62; The ratio of sugar also affects the colour of the wine making the colour more sustained, depending of the nature of the grape <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varietal</a>: a <a href="/Bordeaux_wine" title="Bordeaux wine">Bordeaux</a> <a href="/Sauvignon_blanc" title="Sauvignon blanc">Sauvignon blanc</a> or a <a href="/Muscadet" title="Muscadet">Muscadet</a> <a href="/Melon_de_Bourgogne" title="Melon de Bourgogne">Melon</a> have a greenish tint while <a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">Chardonnay</a> or <a href="/Traminer" title="Traminer">Traminer</a> grown and vinified under comparable conditions will be yellow.&#60;ref name=&#34;peynaud&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>The aromas from white wine cover almost the whole palette of <a href="/Wine_aromas" title="Wine aromas">wine aromas</a>.</p>
<p>The fruity aromas include citrus fruit such as lemon and grapefruit, white fruit such as apple, quince, peach and apricot, and nuts such as walnut and hazelnut. Exotic fruits are also present: pineapple, mango, and lychee. Obviously the aromatic palette includes these cooked flavours: apple, jam, candied fruit, etc. White wines may also convey floral aromas of acacia, honeysuckle, verbena, violet, etc.. (Scents of honey can also be assimilated).</p>
<p>Ageing also brings other flavours to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter, brioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long maturing wines like <a href="/Vin_jaune" title="Vin jaune">yellow wine</a> or <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">sherry</a> have typical aromas of fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Hachette Guide to Wines 2010</i>, Hachette, 2009, 1402 pages, p. 669, Tasting of <a href="/Ch%C3%A2teau-Chalon_(AOC)" title="Château-Chalon (AOC)">Château-Chalon</a> at the winery of <i>Denis and Maris Chevassu</i> 2002, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9782012375147" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9782012375147">ISBN 978-2-01-237514-7</a> {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Hachette Guide to Wines 2010</i>, Hachette, 2009, 1402 pages, p. 669, Tasting of <a href="/Ch%C3%A2teau-Chalon_(AOC)" title="Château-Chalon (AOC)">Château-Chalon</a> at the winery of <i>Macle</i> 2000, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9782012375147" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9782012375147">ISBN 978-2-01-237514-7</a> {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taste">Taste</span></h3>
<p>When placed in the mouth white wine has a balance different from red wine from which the <a href="/Tannin_(wine)" title="Tannin (wine)">tannic</a> structure is removed. The balance is no longer based only on alcohol and acidity: this is the factor that explains the difficulty of making a white wine.</p>
<p>For sweet and fortified white wines the presence of sugar adds a parameter to balance the alcohol and acidity.</p>
<p>Maturing in the barrel gives wine a wooded touch and tannins from the oak give it structure. The strongest wines, as in some <a href="/Cru_(wine)#Grand_cru" title="Cru (wine)">grand crus</a> of <a href="/Sauternes_(wine)" title="Sauternes (wine)">Sauternes</a> (<a href="/Ch%C3%A2teau_d&#39;Yquem" title="Château d&#39;Yquem">Château d&#39;Yquem</a> for example &#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.yquem.fr/yquem.php?lang=fr" rel="nofollow">The mystery of fermentation</a>, Yquem.fr, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;) even support ageing in new wood.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Glasses_for_white_wine">Glasses for white wine</span></h3>
<p>Ever since glass containers have existed, specialised glasses for each type of wine were created. So many glasses, specific to white wine, exist in many wine producing regions.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.saveursdumonde.net/article/details/adapter-le-verre-au-vin-servi" rel="nofollow"><i>Adapt the Glass to the wine served</i></a>, Saveurs du monde.net, consulted on 18 August 2013 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; The glass must be perfectly clear and colourless to properly appreciate the colour of the wine. However, designers and manufacturers of tableware have created white wine glasses with green or blue feet. These colours flatter the wine - they give an artificial colour in the shade (a reflection barrier which emphasizes the separation between the glass and the wine) - rejuvenating the perceived impression.</p>
<p>Sparkling wines are served in particular glasses such as the flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional tasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to the nose of the taster and its height allows appreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its too flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam and the gas and aromas escape too fast.&#60;ref name=&#34;champagne&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.champagne.fr/fr/servir.aspx" rel="nofollow"><i>Service of Champagne</i></a>, Site officiel du champagne, consulted on 8 May 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; According to legend, this type of glass was developed based on the shape of the <a href="/Breast" title="Breast">Breast</a> of the <a href="/Marquise_de_Pompadour" title="Marquise de Pompadour">Marquise de Pompadour</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.jesuiscultive.com/spip.php?article358" rel="nofollow">Legend of the first Champagne coupe</a>, Je suis cultivé.com, consulted on 8 May 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; The coupe dates from a time when the wines were mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the habit to consume drier sparkling wines, the flute has taken the place of the coupe.&#60;ref name=&#34;champagne&#34;/&#62; The coupe is also used in mixtures which have an olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities.</p>
<p>Besides this range of glasses, the work of a team of tasters, including <a href="/Jules_Chauvet" title="Jules Chauvet">Jules Chauvet</a> of the <a href="/INAO" title="INAO">INAO</a> in France, led to the creation in 1970 of the <i>INAO glass</i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.edsoon.com/the-inao-glass-the-objective-standard-adopted-by-the-industry/" rel="nofollow"><i>The INAO Glass</i></a>, edsoon.com, consulted on 18 August 2013&#60;/ref&#62; This glass has a thin glass wall and curve calculated to be able to taste all wines.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dry_white_wine">Dry white wine</span></h3>
<p>The dry white wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar ratio is generally less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine very difficult to develop because the balance of the wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol. This is the wine that the consumer refers to when he speaks of white wine without giving further details.</p>
<p>Before the 1950s, the traditional European wine was made in small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough to interfere with the fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic.&#60;ref group=&#34;b&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;397&#60;/ref&#62; In California and Australia the need to cool the grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate equipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and vats  temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin welded coil shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability). This mode of production happened in Europe at the same time as new techniques of treatment of the <a href="/Must" title="Must">must</a> (accelerated settling, use of selected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give a &#34;technological wine&#34;. This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate, and does not require ageing. The &#34;old&#34; type of European white wines were well suited to this type of wine - it was the <a href="/Sauvignon_blanc" title="Sauvignon blanc">Sauvignon</a> B grape <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varietal</a> that was first used in this manner which allowed it to be blended with <a href="/Semillon" title="Semillon">Semillon</a> B.

<p>There is a wide variety of sweet wines, from slightly sweet all the way to Fortified wine with the consistency of syrup.</p>
<p>The origin of the sugar is from the grape, the fermentation is stopped before it ends, although the practice of <a href="/Chaptalization" title="Chaptalization">chaptalization</a> has changed the practice in certain wine regions. Many techniques exist to concentrate the sugar:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;<a href="/Straw_wine" title="Straw wine">Passerillage</a> with straining&#34; or &#34;late harvest&#34; consists of leaving the grapes on the vine to concentrate the sun. The sugar no longer builds up once reaching maturity but the water evaporates which lowers the yield but increases the concentration of sugar. This is the oldest and most common method. It can be improved by plucking the stems: the winemaker prevents sap reaching the cluster and so it dries faster. The annular incision, long practiced, involves removing a ring of bark on the branch below the clusters, the sweet sap cannot descend and is concentrated in the grapes, while the sap continues to feed the upper branch. Another quick method is to cut a portion of the stem, the grape is dried upstream but the downstream section progresses normally. The blending in the vat or the press of two types of grapes improves the final result&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.vignevin-sudouest.com/publications/compte-rendus-recherche/compte-rendu.php?id=65" rel="nofollow">Passerillage, éclaircissage sur souche</a>, Institut français de la vigne et du vin, consulted on 15 March 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>

<p>{{Main|Sparkling wine}}</p>
<p>Festive Wines par excellence is the prestigious image conveyed by <a href="/Champagne" title="Champagne">champagne</a> but sparkling wine can come from very different practices. In contrast to sparkling wines, wines without foam are called &#34;still wines&#34;.</p>
<p>Sparkling wine is mostly white and contains fermentation gases (carbon dioxide). The first sparkling wine dates back to the very first winemaking. During alcoholic fermentation of all wines yeast produces carbon dioxide so during fermentation all wines are sparkling. For most of them the gas escapes and does not remain dissolved. Methods of production of sparkling wines are therefore intended to maintain the CO2 dissolved in the wine which is responsible for the bubbles:&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/index.en.html" rel="nofollow"><i>A Sparkling Success World-Wide: An Example to Reflect On</i></a>, Effervescents du monde, consulted on 18 August 2013&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<li>the <b>traditional method</b> which was once called <b>méthode champenoise</b> consists of vinifying white or rosé wine as for a still wine. A <i>liqueur de <a href="/Tirage" title="Tirage">tirage</a></i> (sugar) is then added to the wine and bottled. A second fermentation then occurs in the bottle from yeast and the sugar from the liqueur de tirage.

<p>Made famous by the <a href="/Champagne" title="Champagne">champagne</a> used to christen large ships at launch, sparkling white wine is produced in almost all wine-producing countries and has become a benchmark for providing a festive and commemorative spirit to an event. This unique side is found in the labelling of the bottle. Firstly the gas pressure requires a heavier bottle,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.encyclo-ecolo.com/Bouteille_de_champagne" rel="nofollow"><i>The bottles for champagne</i></a>, Encyclo-écolo, consulted on 6 March 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; then the plug with its mushroom shape must be retained by a <a href="/Muselet" title="Muselet">Muselet</a>, and finally the top of the bottle is covered with a metallic foil shell gold or silver coloured.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fortified_wine">Fortified wine</span></h3>

<p>{{Main|Fortified wine}}</p>
<p>A fortified wine is a wine in which there has been an addition of alcohol.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.vignevin-sudouest.com/services-professionnels/formulaires-calcul/mistelle.php" rel="nofollow"><i>Calculation formula for the production of mistelle</i></a>, Institut français de la vigne et du vin, consulted on 13 March 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; This category includes three types of wine products depending on the fermentation stage where the fortification took place:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>mistelles</i> or dessert wines are grape juices whose fermentation has been prevented by fortification with alcohol. Although the absence of fermentation can lead to discussion of their qualification as wine, it is nevertheless an alcoholic grape product. The <a href="/Pineau_des_Charentes" title="Pineau des Charentes">Pineau des Charentes</a>, the <a href="/Floc_de_Gascogne" title="Floc de Gascogne">floc de Gascogne</a>, and the <a href="/Macvin_du_Jura" title="Macvin du Jura">macvin du Jura</a> are three <a href="/Appellation_d&#39;origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e" title="Appellation d&#39;origine contrôlée">AOC</a> French mistelles.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The <i>Vin doux naturel</i> or sweet wines are wines where fermentation was stopped before completion. The added alcohol retains the grape sugar and guarantees its smooth taste. The majority of muscat wines fall into this category (<a href="/Muscat_de_Beaumes-de-Venise" title="Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise">Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise</a>, <a href="/Muscat_de_Rivesaltes" title="Muscat de Rivesaltes">Muscat de Rivesaltes</a>, Muscat de Mireval, <a href="/Moscatell" title="Moscatell">Moscatell</a> Catalan, <a href="/Moscato_d&#39;Asti" title="Moscato d&#39;Asti">Moscato d&#39;Asti</a> etc.) as do <a href="/Port_wine" title="Port wine">white port</a>, and <a href="/Madeira" title="Madeira">Madeira</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The <i>vins mutés secs</i> or dry fortified wines are dry wines (without sugar) whose fermentation was completed. A quantity of alcohol is added to increase their alcohol content. They age for a long time giving wines with the ability to be kept for a very long time. These wines are the <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">sherries</a> and some dry white <a href="/Port_wine" title="Port wine">ports</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The temperature of service is a criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice.&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;52-53&#60;/ref&#62; Between 8 and 9&#38;nbsp;°C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic dry wine service between 10 and 12&#38;nbsp;°C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14&#38;nbsp;°C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Harmony_of_white_wine_and_food">Harmony of white wine and food</span></h3>
<p>The acidity of dry white wine is reduced by slightly salty or sweet dishes while the wine accentuates the salty side of food and tempers heavy fatty foods. Sweet wine goes well with sweet and savoury dishes to mitigate the heavy sugar and stimulate the fruitiness.&#60;ref name=&#34;nul&#34;&#62;Ed McCarthy (Author), Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Author), Ivan-Paul Cassetari (Adapted by), Laure Liger (Adapted by); <i>Wine for Idiots</i>, First Éditions générales, Pour les Nuls, 2007, 540 pages, p. 379-382, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2754009612" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2754009612">ISBN 2754009612</a> {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>For an aperitif, flavoured dry wine or sparkling wine goes with all meals. Specialists in tasting&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;52&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Pierre Casamayor, <i>The School of Alliances, Dishes and Wines</i>, Hachette pratique, October 2000, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2012364616" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2012364616">ISBN 2012364616</a> {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; consider that the sugar or alcohol in some wines has a saturating effect on the taste buds, by contrast the fruity liveliness awakens them to the meal to come.

<p>At mealtimes very dry wines with little minerals are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat.&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;52-53&#60;/ref&#62; For stews the acidity of white wine counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with <a href="/Foie_gras" title="Foie gras">foie gras</a>.&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;52&#60;/ref&#62; Sparkling wines can be taken at any time during the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.</p>
<p><a href="/Gourmet" title="Gourmet">Gourmets</a> generally prefer white wine to red to accompany <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a> as its acidity agrees well with the fat in dairy products.&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;55&#60;/ref&#62; Dry wines with mineral aromas such as <a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">chardonnay</a> or <a href="/Sauvignon_blanc" title="Sauvignon blanc">sauvignon blanc</a> bring out the milky taste of <a href="/Goat_cheese" title="Goat cheese">goat cheese</a>. Aromatic wines, such as <a href="/Gewurztraminer" title="Gewurztraminer">Gewurztraminer</a> and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of <a href="/Washed-rind" title="Washed-rind">Washed-rind</a> cheeses (<a href="/Maroilles_cheese" title="Maroilles cheese">Maroilles</a>, <a href="/%C3%89poisses_de_Bourgogne" title="Époisses de Bourgogne">Epoisses</a>, <a href="/Munster_cheese" title="Munster cheese">Munster</a>, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian <a href="/Trebbiano" title="Trebbiano">Trebbiano</a>) are well suited to <a href="/Ossau-Iraty" title="Ossau-Iraty">sheep cheese</a> and there are also <a href="/Manchego" title="Manchego">Manchego</a> and <a href="/Pecorino_romano" title="Pecorino romano">pecorino romano</a> for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the <a href="/Comt%C3%A9_cheese" title="Comté cheese">Comté cheese</a> and the <a href="/Vin_jaune" title="Vin jaune">yellow wine</a> of the <a href="/Jura_(department)" title="Jura (department)">Jura</a>. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or <a href="/Roquefort" title="Roquefort">Roquefort</a>). In this case, the cheese mould (<a href="/Penicillium_roqueforti" title="Penicillium roqueforti">Penicillium roqueforti</a>) and the wine (<a href="/Noble_rot" title="Noble rot">noble rot</a>) form a harmonious whole.</p>
<p>White wine is also a dessert wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and fortified wines are more suitable for this. Perfumed wines (<a href="/Gewurztraminer" title="Gewurztraminer">Gewurztraminer</a>, <a href="/Muscat_(grape)" title="Muscat (grape)">Muscat</a>), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter.&#60;ref group=&#34;d&#34;&#62;p.&#38;nbsp;55&#60;/ref&#62; Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as <a href="/Juran%C3%A7on_(grape)" title="Jurançon (grape)">Jurançon</a> or a <a href="/Late_harvest" title="Late harvest">late harvest</a> wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.</p>
<p>More than other wines, white wine is a wine that can be consumed between meals. The habits of the Anglo-Saxons and Germans require a sweet wine or a dry and fruity wine.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="White_wine_as_an_ingredient_of_food">White wine as an ingredient of food</span></h3>
<p>White wine is regularly used as an ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness.&#60;ref name=&#34;nul&#34;/&#62; This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps to break down the fibres of the meat to make it tender.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.metro.ca/conseil-expert/boucher/cuisson-barbecue-marinades/secrets-marinade.fr.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Secrets of marinades</i></a>, Métro, mon épicier, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; The role of white wine is similar to that of lemon juice used under the same conditions: once <a href="/Verjuice" title="Verjuice">verjuice</a> also fulfilled this function. The <a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.</p>
<p>As a means to balance the fat white wine is involved in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, <a href="/B%C3%A9arnaise_sauce" title="Béarnaise sauce">béarnaise sauce</a>, <a href="/Marinara_sauce" title="Marinara sauce">marinara sauce</a>, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In <a href="/Cheese_fondue" title="Cheese fondue">cheese fondue</a> the liveliness of dry white wine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Marinade" title="Marinade">marinades</a> its power to soften the protein fibre is used. Sometimes it can even happen in cooking such as in Italian-style tuna carpaccio.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.saveurs-italiennes.com/Carpaccio-de-thon-a-l-italienne.html" rel="nofollow">Italian Tuna Carpaccio</a>, Recettes et saveur d&#39;Italie, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>White wine is also used as a wetting agent for slow cooking. In this type of dish it combines the flexibility of the meat and balances the fat from the sauce. It plays this role in the case of <a href="/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="/Baeckeoffe" title="Baeckeoffe">baeckeoffe</a> or <a href="/Risotto" title="Risotto">risotto</a>, and in the gravy in the preparation of white meat as in <a href="/Osso_buco" title="Osso buco">osso buco</a> or <a href="/Blanquette_de_veau" title="Blanquette de veau">Blanquette de veau</a> (veal stew), Chicken with morels and its variants, Chicken à la comtoise and Yellow <a href="/Coq_au_vin" title="Coq au vin">Coq au vin</a>, <a href="/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a> or with charcuterie such as <a href="/Diot" title="Diot">Diots</a> and <a href="/Tripe" title="Tripe">tripe</a>. It can also be used to prepare fish and seafood dishes such as <i>pôchouse</i> with Burgundy wine, <a href="/Monkfish" title="Monkfish">monkfish</a> stew,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cuisineetvinsdefrance.com/,navarin-de-lotte,24109,10836.asp" rel="nofollow">Navarin de lotte</a>, Cuisine et vins de France, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="/Flounder" title="Flounder">Flounder</a> stew,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cuisineetvinsdefrance.com/,blanquette-de-limande,24109,11631.asp" rel="nofollow">Blanquette de limande</a>, Cuisine et vins de France, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62; mussels in white wine, or a Seafood <a href="/Pot-au-feu" title="Pot-au-feu">Pot-au-feu</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cuisineetvinsdefrance.com/,pot-au-feu-de-la-mer-chantilly-a-l-estragon,24109,10574.asp" rel="nofollow">Seafood Pot-au-feu with cream and tarragon</a>, Cuisine et vins de France, consulted on 30 April 2010 {{Fr}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
