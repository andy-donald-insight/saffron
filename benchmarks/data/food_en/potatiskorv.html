<b>Potatiskorv</b> (more commonly known as <b>värmlandskorv</b> in Sweden) is a regional Swedish sausage from <a href="/V%C3%A4rmland" title="Värmland">Värmland</a>, made with ground pork, beef, onions and potatoes. Potatiskorv is traditionally served hot at Christmas in Värmland but often served hot or cold throughout the year. </p>
<p>Ingredients: 2/3 potatoes, 1/3 meat (half beef, half unseasoned pork), 3/4 lb onions per each lb of meat.
Seasoning: 1-1/2 tblsp salt and 3/4 scant tsp pepper per pound of meat.   </p>
<p>Recipe: 10 lbs potatoes, 2.5 lbs lean beef, 2.5 lbs lean pork, 3.75 lbs onions, 7.5 tblsp salt, 3.5 tsp pepper. Medium or coarse grind potatoes and onions, mix well with <a href="/Ground_meat" title="Ground meat">ground meat</a> and seasoning.  Stuff gently in 12&#34; segments of salted pork casings (well rinsed and softened in warm water).  Cover with mildly salted water and bring to gentle boil for one hour, pricking skins @ 2&#34; intervals to vent pressure and prevent bursting. Makes about 20 lbs.  </p>
<p>&#34;Potatiskorv&#34; is what this sausage is called in parts of Värmland. In most parts of Sweden, the word &#34;potatiskorv&#34; is unknown, while &#34;värmlandskorv&#34; is well known and sold commercially around Christmas throughout the country, for the benefit of people from Värmland. In the United States, &#34;potatiskorv&#34; (usually written &#34;potatis korv&#34;) is the name that has stuck among people with Swedish roots.</p>
<p>There is also a local suasage in parts of <a href="/Sm%C3%A5land" title="Småland">Småland</a> known as &#34;potatiskorv&#34;, mentioned in the <a href="/Emil_i_L%C3%B6nneberga" title="Emil i Lönneberga">Emil</a> children&#39;s books by <a href="/Astrid_Lindgren" title="Astrid Lindgren">Astrid Lindgren</a>. However, that sausage contains no beef, only potatoes and pork.
