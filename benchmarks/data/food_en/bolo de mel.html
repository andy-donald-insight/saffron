<p><b><i>Bolo de mel</i></b> ({{IPA-pt|ˈbolu ðɨ ˈmɛɫ}}, &#34;honey cake&#34;) is a traditional cake from the <a href="/Madeira" title="Madeira">Madeira Islands</a>. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>This cake is considered to be Madeira&#39;s oldest dessert. Started up by Renato José dos Santos, who baked and decorated <a href="/Wedding_cakes" title="Wedding cakes">wedding cakes</a> at {{lang|pt|<i>Fábrica da Estrela</i>}} before its fire of 1964. He proceeded to open his own factory in Rochinha Madeira, baking {{lang|pt|<i>bolo de mel</i>}}, sugared almonds, {{lang|pt|<i>torradas</i>}} (toasts, some recipes call for sweet buns) and {{lang|pt|<i><a href="/Broa" title="Broa">broas</a></i>}} (breads with cornmeal in the recipe, also made with molasses).{{cn|date=July 2015}}</p>

<p>The {{lang|pt|<i>bolo de mel</i>}} cake became a popular confection when the island was an important sugar producer, since the cake itself is traditionally made with <a href="/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a> instead of the now-popular <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>, which meant it could be stored for up to 5 years.{{cn|date=July 2015}} When made with molasses, the cake is very dark in color and has a spongy sticky texture resembling a soft <a href="/Cookie" title="Cookie">cookie</a>. The cake often has <a href="/Walnuts" title="Walnuts">walnuts</a> and <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a> mixed within it. When it is served in Madeira, it is customary not to cut the cake, but rather to tear pieces off using the hands.{{cn|date=July 2015}}</p>
