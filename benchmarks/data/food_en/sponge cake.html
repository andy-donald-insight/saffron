<p><b>Sponge cake</b> is a <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> based on <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> (usually <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> flour), <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, and <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, and is sometimes leavened with <a href="/Baking_powder" title="Baking powder">baking powder</a>. &#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Sponge cake|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/spongecake_1284" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/spongecake_1284</a>|website=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; It has a firm, yet well aerated structure, similar to a <a href="/Sponge" title="Sponge">sea sponge</a>. A sponge cake may be produced by the batter method or the <a href="/Foam_cake" title="Foam cake">foam method</a>.</p>
<p>Cake made using the batter method is known as a butter or <a href="/Pound_cake" title="Pound cake">pound cake</a> in the U.S., while in the U.K. it is known as <a href="/Madeira_cake" title="Madeira cake">Madeira cake</a> or <a href="/Sponge_cake#Victoria_sponge" title="Sponge cake">Victoria sponge cake</a>.

<p>Using the weight of 3 eggs, weigh the fat, sugar, and flour. A typical sponge cake is made by beating the eggs with sugar until they are light and creamy,&#60;ref name=BERO&#62;<i><a href="/Be-Ro" title="Be-Ro">Be-Ro</a> flour Home recipes 40th edition</i>name=Berry&#62;<i>Mary Berry&#39;s Ultimate Cake Book</i> 1995 printing.&#60;/ref&#62; then carefully sieving and folding in the flour (depending on the recipe, the flour may be mixed with a small amount of <a href="/Baking_powder" title="Baking powder">baking powder</a>, though some recipes use only the air incorporated into the egg mixture, relying on the denaturing of the egg proteins and the thermal expansion of the air to provide <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">leavening</a>). Sometimes, the yolks are beaten with the sugar first while the whites are beaten separately to a <a href="/Meringue" title="Meringue">meringue</a>-like foam, to be gently <a href="/Kneading" title="Kneading">folded</a> in later.&#60;ref name=Delia&#62;<i>Delia Smith&#39;s Book of Cakes</i> Sixth Impression 1981.&#60;/ref&#62; The mixture is then poured into the chosen cake tin and baked. Both methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages. This makes a very light product, but it is easy to lose the air by removing the cake before it has finished in the oven.</p>
<p>Before the mixture has cooled after cooking, it is still flexible. This allows the creation of rolled cakes such as the <a href="/Swiss_roll" title="Swiss roll">Swiss roll</a> or the <a href="/B%C3%BBche_de_No%C3%ABl" title="Bûche de Noël">Bûche de Noël</a>.

<p>The <b>Victoria sponge</b>, also known as the <b>Victoria sandwich</b> or <b>Victorian Cake</b>,&#60;ref name=Grdn/&#62; was named after <a href="/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, who was known to enjoy a slice of the sponge cake with her afternoon tea. It is often referred to simply as &#34;sponge cake&#34;, though it contains additional fat.  A typical Victoria sponge consists of <a href="/Raspberry" title="Raspberry">raspberry</a> jam and whipped double cream or vanilla cream.  The jam and cream are sandwiched between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated apart from a dusting of icing sugar.  The <a href="/Women&#39;s_Institute" title="Women&#39;s Institute">Women&#39;s Institute</a> publishes a variation on the Victoria sandwich that has raspberry jam as the filling and is dusted with <a href="/Sucrose#Caster" title="Sucrose">caster sugar</a>, not icing sugar.&#60;ref name=WI&#62;{{cite web|title=Victoria Sandwich|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.thewi.org.uk/what-we-do/recipes/baking/victoria-sandwich" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewi.org.uk/what-we-do/recipes/baking/victoria-sandwich</a>|publisher=National Federation of Women&#39;s Institutes|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A Victoria sponge is made using one of two methods.&#60;ref name=Grdn&#62;{{cite news|last=Cloake|first=Felicity|title=How to make the perfect Victoria sponge cake|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/16/how-bake-perfect-victoria-sponge-cake" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/16/how-bake-perfect-victoria-sponge-cake</a>|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 May 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The traditional method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or <a href="/Food_processor" title="Food processor">food processor</a>, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy.&#60;ref name=BERO/&#62;&#60;ref name=Delia/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Berry&#34;/&#62; Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine.&#60;ref name=Grdn/&#62; Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture one of the most popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic &#39;cake&#39; mixture has been made into an endless variety of treats and puddings, including <a href="/Cupcake" title="Cupcake">cupcakes</a>, <a href="/Chocolate_cake" title="Chocolate cake">chocolate cake</a>, <a href="/Eve&#39;s_pudding" title="Eve&#39;s pudding">Eve&#39;s pudding</a>, and many others.&#60;ref name=BERO/&#62;&#60;ref name=Delia/&#62;&#60;ref name=Berry/&#62;</p>
<p>Sponge cakes can also be made suitable for vegan, lacto-ovo intolerant, and low cholesterol diets. Most often this is done by using plant based milk instead of dairy (such as rice milk or soya milk) and vegetable oil, flax seeds, bananas, or powdered egg replacers, instead of eggs.</p>
<p>Although simple to make, Victoria sponge recipes are notoriously sensitive to <a href="/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a> times and temperatures. As such, <a href="/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a> manufacturers often use a Victoria sponge recipe to test their ovens.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GU_QCjFAaGEC&#38;pg=PA318&#38;lpg=PA318" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GU_QCjFAaGEC&#38;pg=PA318&#38;lpg=PA318</a> |title=Gas Installation Technology] |author= Treloar, Roy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|date= 2005 |isbn= 1-4051-1880-6}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Since sponge cakes are not leavened with yeast, they are popular dessert choices for the <a href="/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a> feast.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|url=<a class="external free" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DA1F3CF93BA15750C0A965958260&#38;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/P/Passover" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DA1F3CF93BA15750C0A965958260&#38;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/P/Passover</a> |title=FOOD: Healthful Tips for Passover Favorites|author= Fabricant, Florence|work=<a href="/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>|date= March 28, 1993|accessdate= October 20, 2007}}&#60;/ref&#62; Typically, Passover sponges are made with <a href="/Matzo" title="Matzo">matzo</a> meal, matzo flour, or potato flour, since raw wheat products may not be used.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|url=<a class="external free" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DA1F3FF93BA35757C0A966958260" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DA1F3FF93BA35757C0A966958260</a> |title=FOOD: Meeting the Challenge of a Dessert for the Passover Meal|author=Fabricant, Florence|work=<a href="/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>|date= April 8, 1990|accessdate= October 20, 2007}}&#60;/ref&#62;  No raising agent may be used due to the strict prohibition of even the appearance of a leavening effect. Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover Sponge recipe. So popular is the sponge cake at Passover that most families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations which is referred to as the <i>Passover Sponge Cake</i>, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical Passover sponge flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppyseeds. Either apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the <a href="/Seder" title="Seder">Seder</a> service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit <a href="/Compote" title="Compote">compote</a>.{{cn|date=November 2015}}</p>
