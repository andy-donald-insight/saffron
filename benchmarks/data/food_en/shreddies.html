<p>In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the cereal was first produced by Nabisco&#39;s former UK division but is now made by <a href="/Cereal_Partners_Worldwide" title="Cereal Partners Worldwide">Cereal Partners</a> under the <a href="/Nestl%C3%A9" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> brand at <a href="/Welwyn_Garden_City" title="Welwyn Garden City">Welwyn Garden City</a>. The factory opened in 1926. It began making Shreddies in 1953. The site was briefly owned by <a href="/Rank_Hovis_McDougall" title="Rank Hovis McDougall">Rank Hovis McDougall</a> in 1988, who sold it to Cereal Partners in 1990. Nestlé&#39;s site at <a href="/Staverton%2C_Wiltshire" title="Staverton, Wiltshire">Staverton</a> started making Shreddies in 1998, and is where all production was moved to in 2007.</p>
<p>In Canada, production began in 1939 at Lewis Avenue, <a href="/Niagara_Falls" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, <a href="/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. Shreddies were produced under the <a href="/Nabisco" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a> name until the brand in Canada was purchased in 1993 by Post Cereals whose parent company in 1995 became <a href="/Kraft_Foods" title="Kraft Foods">Kraft General Foods</a> which sold Post to <a href="/Ralcorp" title="Ralcorp">Ralcorp</a> in 2008 and is now Post Foods Canada Corp., a unit of <a href="/Post_Foods" title="Post Foods">Post Holdings</a>, which was spun off from Ralcorp in 2012.</p>
<p>The cereal is marketed with the <i>whole grain</i> symbol, as part of a marketing campaign emphasising the healthiness of the cereal. Wheat for Shreddies is sourced from over 500 different farms within the UK.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.trulyresponsible.org/food/nestle" rel="nofollow">trulyresponsible.org » Nestlé - Shreddies&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Sugared, chocolate and honey-flavoured versions of the cereal are available in the UK as <i>Frosted Shreddies</i>, <i>Coco Shreddies</i> and <i>Honey Shreddies</i>, and an orange-flavoured version of the Coco Shreddies has also become available recently.

<ul>
<li>For many years in the UK the Shreddies boxes featured Tom and Jerry (from the MGM cartoons). They regularly featured gifts in the boxes featuring Tom and Jerry, such as glow in the dark stickers sets, and puzzle books.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>For a few years, Shreddies&#39; advert campaigns featured a cartoon personification of &#34;Hunger&#34; as an antagonist. He appeared as a blue monster with big teeth whose goal it was to taunt hungry individuals by drumming on their stomachs with a pair of silver spoons. Hunger would then be dispatched when the victim consumed a bowl of Shreddies, sealing Hunger inside a shreddie cage. Despite his troublesome persona, Hunger was frequently used as a mascot for the cereal during this period.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1-Kh8Rgmes&#38;feature=related" rel="nofollow">Shreddies - Keeps Hunger Locked up till lunch - YouTube&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The message during this time was &#34;Shreddies keep hunger locked up &#39;til lunch&#34; and most ads ended with a box of Shreddies rolling up in front of Hunger who then gets crushed in between it and a box of Frosted Shreddies zooming in from behind him.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>For a while in the early 2000s, Frosted and Coco Shreddies were advertised as &#34;too tasty for geeks.&#34; The adverts would feature &#34;geeks&#34; trying to eat a bowl of either Frosted or Coco Shreddies, but being overwhelmed by its taste, followed by a much cooler kid named Sure-Eddie being able to easily eat the Shreddies. In 2003, Coco Shreddies was coated with more chocolate.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In 2005, Shreddies was advertised as School fuel. The advert showed school children being focused on their work at school after eating a bowl of Shreddies for breakfast at home. This TV advert was ordered to be removed by the <a href="/Advertising_Standards_Authority_(United_Kingdom)" title="Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)">ASA</a> as it was held to provide an unfair comparison between school children eating Shreddies or eating nothing, rather than a similar cereal.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/news/news/2006/Serial+complaints.htm" rel="nofollow">Serial complaints&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In 2007 Shreddies&#39; advertising centred on the claim that they are &#34;knitted by nanas&#34; with shots of a factory full of grandmothers knitting Shreddies.  The ad was voted the 7th favourite ad of 2007.  And from 2007 - 2011 the packaging was changed to include a photo on the inner flaps of the nana who apparently knitted the specific box.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In 2010, supporting the launch of a new &#34;Scrumptious new recipe&#34;, Shreddies launched a promotion to find new nanas, using TV, Digital and Facebook, this subsequently built a huge fan base on Facebook.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.facebook.com/knittingnanas" rel="nofollow">Shreddies Facebook Fan page</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  The fan page is now the 2nd largest cereal fansite in the world, providing entertainment, competitions and launching new ads to its loyal followers.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In 2012 the Shreddies Knitting Nanas continued to be used to represent the brand.  The campaign was launched on Facebook to the fans in a 1-month build up to the premiere, with the ad going live on TV weeks later in April.  The campaign message in 2012 was &#34;Helping you through &#39;til lunch&#34; (a reference to the early 90s strapline)&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wggt1h-THRs&#38;list=UUcF9tOPVHOJVexcjSSB7TTw&#38;index=1&#38;feature=plcp" rel="nofollow">Shreddies 2012 Ad on Youtube</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqgJU3A0UnE&#38;feature=relmfu" rel="nofollow">Shreddies Trailer for new Ad on Youtube</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>A new advert in 2014 replaced the message with &#34;Shreddies ...AND YOU&#39;RE READY!&#34; The advert features the song &#34;<a href="/This_Is_How_We_Do_It" title="This Is How We Do It">This Is How We Do It</a>&#34; by <a href="/Montell_Jordan" title="Montell Jordan">Montell Jordan</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>In Canada the cereal has been known for many years by its musical <a href="/Jingle" title="Jingle">jingle</a>, &#34;Good Good Whole-Wheat Shreddies&#34;. The mascots of the cereal in Canada were Freddie and Eddie, two <a href="/Anthropomorphic" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> (yet legless) pieces of the cereal. Around 1993, their appearance changed to that of a younger youthful age complete with <a href="/Baseball_cap" title="Baseball cap">baseball caps</a> and they also grew hair and legs. By the late 1990s, the characters were discontinued in all advertising and packaging. The cereal is now marketed as an &#34;adult&#34; cereal.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In January 2008, the company launched a new ad campaign for so-called &#34;Diamond Shreddies.&#34; The tongue-in-cheek ads claimed the cereal&#39;s shape had been changed to diamond, and presented the original square Shreddies, rotated 45 degrees. Consumer reaction to the campaign has translated into a statistically significant sales increase, according to at least one media report on the campaign&#39;s success.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.macleans.ca/business/companies/article.jsp?content=20080507_56414_56414" rel="nofollow">Maclean&#39;s Article, May 2008</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The campaign won the 2008 Grand <a href="/Clio_Award" title="Clio Award">Clio Award</a> for Integrated (i.e. multiple media) Campaign.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.clioawards.com/winners/index.cfm?medium_id=6" rel="nofollow">Clio 2008&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>

<p>Shreddies featured as a plot device in the Canadian mockumentary television series created and directed by Mike Clattenburg, The Trailer Park Boys. Shreddies were part of the survival supplies Julian, Ricky and Bubbles sent with Jacob Collins and his Boys on their outing to lay a model train track across the Canada- US border in the episode We Can&#39;t Call People Without Wings Angels, So We Call Them Friends. Other supplies sent with them included liquorice and cannabis. The train track Jacob and his minions constructed was intended for use in smuggling cannabis across the Canada - US border.
