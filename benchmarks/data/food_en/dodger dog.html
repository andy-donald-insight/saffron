The <b>Dodger Dog</b> is a <a href="/Hot_dog" title="Hot dog">hot dog</a> named after the <a href="/Major_League_Baseball" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> franchise that sells them (the <a href="/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>).

According to the <a href="/National_Hot_Dog_and_Sausage_Council" title="National Hot Dog and Sausage Council">National Hot Dog and Sausage Council</a>, the projected number of 2011 season hot dogs sold at Dodger Stadium was 2 million — establishing Farmer John Dodger Dogs as the leader in hot dog sales of all those sold in Major League Baseball ballparks.&#60;ref&#62;Urner Barry&#39;s Reporter Vol. 6. No. 4 (2011): 8. Print&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There are two lines for Dodger Dog vendors: steamed or grilled. The vendors of the grilled dogs are typically located near the back wall of the stadium so that the smoke doesn&#39;t overwhelm the baseball fans. The grilled Dogs are considered the &#34;classic&#34; version.</p>
<p>The success of the <b>Dodger Dog</b> has spawned a small chain of restaurants in the <a href="/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> area. One such restaurant named Dodger Dogs can be found in <a href="/Universal_City%2C_California" title="Universal City, California">Universal City, California</a>. The Dodger Dog is also available in the “Super Dodger Dog” variation, which is made of 100% beef as opposed to a beef/pork blend. It is believed that Dodger Dogs were first called &#34;Dodger Dogs&#34; in 1958 when the Dodgers first came to Los Angeles from Brooklyn. Dodger Dog weiners are also sold to the public in Southern California supermarkets under the Farmer John brand.  In 2011, the Dodgers introduced a Mexican-themed &#34;Doyer Dog&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news |title=Thomas G. Arthur, 84; Made Dodger Dogs a Staple of L.A.

<p>The Dodger Dog is also served at <a href="/Chickasaw_Bricktown_Ballpark" title="Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark">Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark</a> in Oklahoma City, OK, the home of the <a href="/Dodgers" title="Dodgers">Dodgers</a> AAA affiliate <a href="/Oklahoma_City_Dodgers" title="Oklahoma City Dodgers">Oklahoma City Dodgers</a>. A concession area called the &#34;Dog Pound&#34; serves hot dogs from stadiums around the country including the Fenway Frank, Cincinnati Cheese Coney, Milwaukee Brat, and The Red Hot Chicago Dog. The Dodger Dog was not, however, served at the Dodgers&#39; spring training ballpark, <a href="/Camelback_Ranch" title="Camelback Ranch">Camelback Ranch</a>, during the team&#39;s first spring training at the park.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news |title=Dodgers&#39; new spring home in Phoenix is a site to behold|author=Bill Plaschke |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2009-03-08 |url=<a class="external free" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/08/sports/sp-plaschke8" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/08/sports/sp-plaschke8</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;  This was changed for the 2010 Spring Training season where the Dodger Dog was either cooked on a hot dog roller or steamed.</p>

<p>Thomas Arthur created the &#34;Dodger Dog&#34; during his 29 years (1962–1991) as the food concessions manager at Dodger Stadium. The 10-inch frank was originally made by the Morrell Meat Company, but <a href="/Hormel" title="Hormel">Farmer John</a>, one of the Dodgers&#39; chief sponsors, soon took over the frank needs of the stadium.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news |title=Thomas G.
