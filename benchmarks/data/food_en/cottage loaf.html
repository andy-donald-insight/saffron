<p><b>Cottage loaves</b> are a traditional type of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> originating in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>A cottage loaf is characterised by its shape, which is essentially that of two round loaves, one on top of the other, with the upper one being rather smaller: the shape is similar to that of the French <a href="/Brioche" title="Brioche">brioche</a> and the <i>pain chapeau</i> of <a href="/Finist%C3%A8re" title="Finistère">Finistère</a>.&#60;ref name=ocf&#62;Davidson, A. <i>The Oxford companion to food</i>, OUP, 2006, p.99&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The origins of the name and shape are unknown but possibly extend back hundreds of years.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book| last = Cauvain| first =Stanley P. |author2=Linda S.

<p>Cottage loaves, while formerly common, are now rarely found in bakeries, as they are relatively time-consuming and difficult to make, and in common with other round loaves are less convenient for <a href="/Sliced_bread" title="Sliced bread">slicing</a>.</p>
