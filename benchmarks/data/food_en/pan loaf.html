<p>A <b>pan loaf</b> is a style of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> loaf baked in a pan or tin.&#60;ref name=&#34;CSD&#34;&#62;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Mairi|title=The Concise Scots Dictionary|year=1985|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|isbn=0-08-028492-2|pages=472}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Caley Merc&#34;&#62;{{cite web|title=Useful Scots Words: Pan Loaf|url=<a class="external free" href="http://caledonianmercury.com/2012/06/27/useful-scots-word-pan-loaf/0034577" rel="nofollow">http://caledonianmercury.com/2012/06/27/useful-scots-word-pan-loaf/0034577</a>|work=Caledonian Mercury|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; It is the most common style available in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, though the term itself is predominantly <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> so as to differentiate it from the Scottish <a href="/Plain_loaf" title="Plain loaf">plain loaf</a>.

<p>The pan loaf has a soft pale brown crust all round the bread, in contrast to a plain loaf&#39;s darker crust only at the top and bottom.&#60;ref name=&#34;Caley Merc&#34;/&#62;</p>
