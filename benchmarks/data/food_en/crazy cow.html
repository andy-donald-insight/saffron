<b>Crazy Cow</b> was a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> produced by <a href="/General_Mills" title="General Mills">General Mills</a> during the 1970s. The cereal was somewhat of a novelty item in that it had an unusual trait. The round, multi-grain <a href="/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal</a> pellets were coated with an excipient of a drink mix. When milk was added, it would dissolve the powdered coating, and the resultant mixture would resemble in sight, smell, and taste, a flavored milk. Crazy Cow came in two flavors, <a href="/Chocolate" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> and <a href="/Strawberry" title="Strawberry">strawberry</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://theimaginaryworld.com/mills.html" rel="nofollow">Crazy Cow boxes&#39; images</a>&#60;/ref&#62; As the box indicated, these were just flavors; no actual chocolate or strawberries were in the ingredients. The box always contained the disclaimer &#34;artificially flavored&#34; or &#34;chocolate flavored&#34;. </p>
<p>The front of the Crazy Cow box usually had a large cartoon cow, smiling cheerfully. On the box for both strawberry and chocolate Crazy Cow, the cow was white with brown spots and was wearing a hat and a <a href="/Cowbell" title="Cowbell">cowbell</a> around his neck. The back of the box often included enticements in the form of images of promotional items included for &#34;free&#34; in the box. One promotional item was <a href="/Star_Wars_Trading_Cards" title="Star Wars Trading Cards">Star Wars Trading Cards</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://theswca.com/images-food/cereal-us-chart.html" rel="nofollow">Images of Star Wars Card promotional edition</a>&#60;/ref&#62; These were highly collectible because they were a different variety than those sold in packs. </p>
