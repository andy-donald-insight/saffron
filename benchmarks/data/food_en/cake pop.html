<p>
Cake pops use many of the ingredients used in baking a traditional <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> and can be made from cakes of any flavor. Many recipes found online use a cake mix instead of creating a cake batter from scratch. Either way, cake pops and cakes have their similarities.</p>
<p>Once the cake has been baked, or when leftovers from an existing cake have been collected, it is crumbled into pieces. These crumbs are mixed into a bowl of frosting or melted chocolate, and the resulting mixture is shaped into balls, cubes or other shapes. Each ball is attached to a lollipop stick. Once the mixture solidifies, it can be decorated with frosting or melted chocolate and sprinkles. The cake balls can be frozen to speed the solidification process.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/life/5-desserts-that-reimagine-your-favorite-foods.html/?a=viewall&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://wallstcheatsheet.com/life/5-desserts-that-reimagine-your-favorite-foods.html/?a=viewall&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>Most of the time making a cake pop is spent on shaping the cake into a desirable form and decorating it. Simple shapes such as spheres can be molded by hands, but complex shapes require tools. Silicone molding pan and cookie cutters are popular tools used in shaping cake pops.</p>
