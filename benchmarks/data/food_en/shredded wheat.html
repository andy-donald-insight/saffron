<p><b>Shredded wheat</b> is a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> made from <a href="/Whole_grain" title="Whole grain">whole</a> <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> formed into <a href="/Pillow" title="Pillow">pillow</a>-like biscuits. As of January 2010, it was available in three sizes — bite sized (¾×1 in), miniature (nearly half the size of the bite-sized pieces), and original. Both smaller sizes are available in a <a href="/Frosted_Mini-Wheats" title="Frosted Mini-Wheats">frosted</a> variety, which has one side coated with <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> and usually <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a>. Some manufacturers have produced &#34;filled&#34; versions of the bite-size cereal containing a raisin at the center, or apricot, blueberry, raspberry or cranberry filling.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, shredded wheat is most heavily advertised and marketed by <a href="/Post_Foods" title="Post Foods">Post Foods</a>, which acquired the product in 1993 through its parent company, <a href="/Kraft_Foods" title="Kraft Foods">Kraft Foods</a>, buying it from its long-time producer <a href="/Nabisco" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a>. <a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg&#39;s</a> sells eight varieties of miniature, or bite-sized, shredded wheat cereal. Natural and organic manufacturer Barbara&#39;s Bakery makes an all-natural version of shredded wheat. In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the Shredded Wheat brand is owned by <a href="/Cereal_Partners_Worldwide" title="Cereal Partners Worldwide">Cereal Partners</a>, a <a href="/Nestl%C3%A9" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a>/<a href="/General_Mills" title="General Mills">General Mills</a> company, although there are many generic versions and variants by different names. It was first made in the United States in 1893, while UK production began in 1926.</p>

<a href="/Henry_Perky" title="Henry Perky">Henry Perky</a> invented shredded wheat cereal in <a href="/Denver%2C_Colorado" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, in 1890. Inspired by his observation of a dyspeptic diner blending wheat with cream, he developed a method of processing wheat into strips that were formed into pillow-like biscuits.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SJGNAgAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA180&#38;lpg=PA180&#38;dq=sunshine+shredded+wheat+history&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=mfYafklT1J&#38;sig=szI9EUEvcpDKLggu8Em0VSe4JSI&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ei=3jI3U9LyIonhsATXhILwBg&#38;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&#38;q=sunshine%20shredded%20wheat%20history&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">Snodgrass, Mary Ellen, <i>Encyclopedia of Kitchen History</i>, London: Routledge, 2004, p. 180.</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The wheat is first cooked in water until its moisture content reaches about 50%. It is then <i>tempered</i>, allowing moisture to diffuse evenly into the grain. The grain then passes through a set of rollers with grooves in one side, yielding a web of shredded wheat strands. Many webs are stacked together, and this moist stack of strands is crimped at regular intervals to produce individual pieces of cereal with the strands attached at each end. These then go into an oven, where they are baked until their moisture content is reduced to 5%.</p>
<p>Perky first sold his shredded wheat cereal to vegetarian restaurants in 1892, distributing it from a factory in <a href="/Niagara_Falls%2C_New_York" title="Niagara Falls, New York">Niagara Falls, New York</a>. A health-oriented publication, <i>The Chicago Vegetarian</i>, recommended the use of shredded wheat biscuits as soup croutons. At the same time, Perky leased cereal-manufacturing machines to bakers in <a href="/Denver" title="Denver">Denver</a> and <a href="/Colorado_Springs" title="Colorado Springs">Colorado Springs</a> through his Cereal Machine Company and sold wheat processors. </p>
<p>One of his wheat-processor buyers, Dr. <a href="/John_Harvey_Kellogg" title="John Harvey Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a>, admired Perky&#39;s manufacturing process for his shredded wheat cereal.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SJGNAgAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA180&#38;lpg=PA180&#38;dq=sunshine+shredded+wheat+history&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=mfYafklT1J&#38;sig=szI9EUEvcpDKLggu8Em0VSe4JSI&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ei=3jI3U9LyIonhsATXhILwBg&#38;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&#38;q=sunshine%20shredded%20wheat%20history&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">Snodgrass, <i>op. cit.</i></a>&#60;/ref&#62; Kellogg declined to purchase Perky&#39;s patent on it, however, considering it too weak in taste, &#34;like eating a whisk broom.&#34; However, after co-founding the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company — later the <a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg Company</a> cereal manufacturer — with his brother <a href="/Will_Keith_Kellogg" title="Will Keith Kellogg">Will Keith Kellogg</a> in 1906, John Kellogg observed the success of Perky&#39;s product and offered to buy its patent from him, but at too low a price to pique Perky&#39;s interest.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.beachpackagingdesign.com/wp/2011/04/shredded-wheat-documents-cereal-as-intellectual-property.html" rel="nofollow">Ludacer, Randy, &#34;Shredded Wheat Documents: Cereal as Intellectual Property,&#34; <i>Beach Packaging Design,</i> April 19, 2011.</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

It became the Shredded Wheat Company in 1904. It was bought by <a href="/Nabisco" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a> (National Biscuit Company) in December 1928. </p>
<p>United States production of Shredded Wheat moved to <a href="/Naperville%2C_Illinois" title="Naperville, Illinois">Naperville, Illinois</a> in 1954, where it is still made. In 1993, Nabisco sold the brand to <a href="/Kraft_Foods" title="Kraft Foods">Kraft General Foods</a>, but it was still under the Nabisco name until 1999, whereupon it was sold under the slogan &#34;Nabisco brought to you by Post.&#34;</p>
<p>Canadian production has been at <a href="/Niagara_Falls%2C_Ontario" title="Niagara Falls, Ontario">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>, since 1904 due to nearby <a href="/Hydro-electric" title="Hydro-electric">hydro-electric</a> power. United States production is also at Niagara Falls, Ontario. Until recently, United States production took place in Niagara Falls, New York, but that factory was closed when production was consolidated on the Canadian side of the border.</p>
<p>In 1920, Henry Perky&#39;s son, Scott Henry Perky, developed a round shredded wheat cereal, which he named Muffets. The Muffets Corporation was sold to the <a href="/Quaker_Oats_Company" title="Quaker Oats Company">Quaker Oats Company</a> in 1927. The cereal is still marketed in Canada as Muffets, but in the U.S. is now sold as Quaker Shredded Wheat.</p>

<p>The original company opened a factory in <a href="/Welwyn_Garden_City" title="Welwyn Garden City">Welwyn Garden City</a>, <a href="/Hertfordshire" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> in 1926 at which time Welgar was its registered trade mark, which became part of <a href="/Nabisco" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a> in 1928.&#60;ref&#62;Butterfield, Richard J: <i>The Industrial Archaeology of the Twentieth Century: The Shredded Wheat Factory at Welwyn Garden City</i> in Industrial Archaeology Review: Volume 16 (1994), page 196 ff.&#60;/ref&#62; The tall concrete cereal silos that form part of the factory are a local landmark and are listed structures. The first 18 storage units were completed in 1926 with a further 27 constructed in 1938, in both instances they were built by <a href="/Peter_Lind_%26_Company" title="Peter Lind &amp; Company">Peter Lind &#38; Company</a> of London who continue in business today. In 1988, Nabisco sold the UK site to <a href="/Rank_Hovis_McDougall" title="Rank Hovis McDougall">Rank Hovis McDougall</a> (who made own-label cereals for supermarkets), whose breakfast cereals division briefly became the <i>Shredded Wheat Company</i>. In 1990, RHM sold the site to <a href="/Cereal_Partners_Worldwide" title="Cereal Partners Worldwide">Cereal Partners</a>. Now, all Shredded Wheat is made at <a href="/Staverton%2C_Wiltshire" title="Staverton, Wiltshire">Staverton</a>, <a href="/Wiltshire" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> near <a href="/Bath%2C_Somerset" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a>, <a href="/Somerset" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, as the Welwyn Garden City site was shut down in 2008. Also, &#34;Bitesize&#34;, &#34;Fruitful&#34; and &#34;Honey Nut&#34; Shredded Wheat are made in the UK.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Advertising">Advertising</span></h4>
<p>Shredded Wheat has a particular place in UK popular culture due to a long-running television advertising campaign. {{anchor|ThereAreTwoMenInMyLife}}The campaign in the 1970s featured <a href="/Linda_Hoyle" title="Linda Hoyle">Linda Hoyle</a>, singing the lyrics:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&#34;There are two men in my life, </dd>
<dd>To one I am a mother,</dd>
<dd>To the other I&#39;m a wife,</dd>
<dd>And I give them both the best</dd>
<dd>With natural Shredded Wheat&#34;</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <i>Three Shredded Wheat</i> campaign, which came later, suggested that the cereal was so nourishing that it was impossible to eat three. Even a <a href="/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black hole</a> was shown as exploding when the third biscuit was sucked into it. Phrases such as <i>I bet you can&#39;t eat three</i> and <i>He must have eaten three</i> were in common use as humorous remarks in the 1970s and 1980s, with celebrities such as <a href="/Brian_Clough" title="Brian Clough">Brian Clough</a>, <a href="/Peter_Shilton" title="Peter Shilton">Peter Shilton</a>, <a href="/Richard_Kiel" title="Richard Kiel">Richard Kiel</a> and <a href="/Ian_Botham" title="Ian Botham">Ian Botham</a> all &#39;unable&#39; to eat three.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=CDP Classic ads - Shredded Wheat (1980-1981)|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMl53u1J70" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMl53u1J70</a>|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/brian-clough-shredded-wheat-tv-advert/3057771927" rel="nofollow">UK television advertisement starring [[Brian Clough</a>] and <a href="/Peter_Shilton" title="Peter Shilton">Peter Shilton</a> on <a href="/Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> 22 February 1992]&#60;/ref&#62; A later UK poster advertisement for <a href="/Carling_Black_Label" title="Carling Black Label">Carling Black Label</a> showed a bowl with four Shredded Wheat and the caption &#34;I bet he drinks Carling Black Label.&#34;</p>

<p>After <a href="/Henry_Perky" title="Henry Perky">Henry Perky</a> died in 1908 and the patent on his Shredded Wheat biscuit expired in 1912, <a href="/John_Harvey_Kellogg" title="John Harvey Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a> saw that as an opportunity for <a href="/Kellogg&#39;s" title="Kellogg&#39;s">Kellogg&#39;s</a> to sell its own version of the product.

This provoked <a href="/National_Biscuit_Company" title="National Biscuit Company">National Biscuit Company</a> to sue Kellogg for trademark infringement, attempting to enjoin him from using <i>Shredded Wheat</i> as a trade name and from manufacturing the cereal in its pillow-shaped form.
