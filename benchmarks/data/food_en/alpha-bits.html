<p>Beginning in 1964, the mascot for Alpha-Bits was a <a href="/Mail_carrier" title="Mail carrier">postman</a>, possibly a <a href="/Pun" title="Pun">pun</a> on &#34;<a href="/Post_Holdings" title="Post Holdings">Post</a> Man&#34; named <b>Loveable Truly</b>, who was originally voiced by <a href="/Insult_comedy" title="Insult comedy">insult comic</a> <a href="/Jack_E._Leonard" title="Jack E. Leonard">Jack E. Leonard</a> in a Southern accent. Loveable Truly was also a character in the 1960s cartoon show <i><a href="/Linus_the_Lionhearted" title="Linus the Lionhearted">Linus the Lionhearted</a></i> on <a href="/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>, along with other Post Cereals mascots at the time (including <a href="/Sugar_Bear" title="Sugar Bear">Sugar Bear</a> of <a href="/Golden_Crisp" title="Golden Crisp">Golden Crisp</a>, then called Sugar Crisp).</p>
<p>Since then, mascots have included the <b>Alpha-Bits Wizard</b>, who appeared near children in kitchens.</p>
<p>In Canada, the last Alpha-Bits mascot was <b>Alpha</b>, a computer who &#34;makes bits&#34;. As of 2014, he has been discontinued. The Canadian <b>Alpha</b> at first resembled <a href="/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC">IBM PCs</a>, but recent versions resemble a 2006 <a href="/IMac" title="IMac">iMac</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1980s there was yet another mascot named <b>Alfie the Alpha-Bits Cereal Wonder Dog</b>. <a href="/Michael_Jackson" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> and <a href="/The_Jackson_5" title="The Jackson 5">The Jackson 5</a> starred in a series of Alpha-Bits musical TV commercials in 1973.</p>

<p><b>Marshmallow Alpha-Bits</b>, introduced in 1990, contained frosted <a href="/Alphabet" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a>-shaped corn cereal bits and <a href="/Marshmallow" title="Marshmallow">marshmallows</a>.  This variation of the original Alpha-Bits cereal contained marshmallow vowels: pink A&#39;s, yellow E&#39;s, purple I&#39;s, orange O&#39;s, green U&#39;s, and, later, blue Y&#39;s.  Over time, the marshmallows underwent changes such as super-swirls and splits in their colors. As of 2011, Marshmallow Alpha-Bits have been discontinued.</p>
<p>Marshmallow Alpha-Bits were invented by a small-time entrepreneur named Andrew R. Miller and his cousin Andrew W. Peterson, the latter of whom was a chef at a local restaurant in <a href="/Upstate_New_York" title="Upstate New York">upstate New York</a>. The pair sold the idea to Post in 1989. {{Citation needed| date=January 2012}}</p>
