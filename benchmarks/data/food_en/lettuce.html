<p><b>Lettuce</b> (<i>Lactuca sativa</i>) is an <a href="/Annual_plant" title="Annual plant">annual plant</a> of the daisy family <a href="/Asteraceae" title="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>. It is most often grown as a <a href="/Leaf_vegetable" title="Leaf vegetable">leaf vegetable</a>, but sometimes for its stem and seeds. Lettuce was first cultivated by the <a href="/Ancient_Egyptians" title="Ancient Egyptians">ancient Egyptians</a> who turned it from a <a href="/Weed" title="Weed">weed</a>, whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves, in addition to its oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name &#34;<i><a href="/Lactuca" title="Lactuca">lactuca</a></i>&#34;, from which the English &#34;lettuce&#34; is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, multiple types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several <a href="/Herbal" title="Herbal">herbals</a>. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many <a href="/Variety_(botany)" title="Variety (botany)">varieties</a> in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>Generally grown as a <a href="/Hardiness_(plants)" title="Hardiness (plants)">hardy</a> annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly. It can be plagued with numerous <a href="/Micronutrient_deficiency" title="Micronutrient deficiency">nutrient deficiencies</a>, as well as insect and mammal pests and fungal and bacterial diseases. <i>L. sativa</i> <a href="/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">crosses</a> easily within the species and with some other species within the <i>Lactuca</i> genus; although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the <a href="/Gene_pool" title="Gene pool">gene pool</a> of cultivated lettuce varieties. World production of lettuce and <a href="/Chicory" title="Chicory">chicory</a> for calendar year 2010 stood at 23 620 000/23,620,000 tonnes, half of which came from China.</p>
<p>Lettuce is most often used for <a href="/Salad" title="Salad">salads</a>, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/grilledlettucewithgo_14300" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/grilledlettucewithgo_14300</a>|title=Grilled lettuce with goats&#39; cheese|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2013|author=Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall}}&#60;/ref&#62; One variety, the Woju (莴苣) or <a href="/Celtuce" title="Celtuce">asparagus lettuce</a>, is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. Lettuce is a rich source of <a href="/Vitamin_K" title="Vitamin K">vitamin K</a> and <a href="/Vitamin_A" title="Vitamin A">vitamin A</a>, and is a moderate source of <a href="/Folate" title="Folate">folate</a> and <a href="/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a>. Contaminated  lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including <i><a href="/Escherichia_coli" title="Escherichia coli">E. coli</a></i> and <i><a href="/Salmonella" title="Salmonella">Salmonella</a></i>. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption.</p>

<p>Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies. Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety&#39;s name from year to year. This was done for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a &#34;new&#34; variety or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company. Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types&#38;nbsp;– a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time. Names also often changed significantly from country to country.&#60;ref&#62;Weaver, pp. 173–174.&#60;/ref&#62; Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of <a href="/Tobacco-free_cigarettes" title="Tobacco-free cigarettes">tobacco-free cigarettes</a>; however, domestic lettuce&#39;s wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.&#60;ref name=&#34;Katz377&#34; /&#62;</p>

<li>Iceberg/Crisphead - the most popular type in the US, it is very heat-sensitive and was originally adapted for growth in the northern US. It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.&#60;ref name=&#34;UI&#34; /&#62;</li>
<li>Butterhead&#38;nbsp;– Also known as Boston or Bibb lettuce,&#60;ref name=&#34;WSU&#34; /&#62; this type is a head lettuce with a loose arrangement of leaves, known for its sweet flavor and tender texture.&#60;ref name=&#34;UI&#34; /&#62;</li>

<p>Western Europe and North America were the original major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, with the development of iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production.&#60;ref name=&#34;Katz378&#34;&#62;Katz and Weaver, p. 378.&#60;/ref&#62; Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.&#60;ref name=&#34;Simoons&#34;&#62;{{cite book|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/?id=Fo087ZxohA4C&#38;pg=PA148&#38;lpg=PA148&#38;dq=lettuce+consumption+in+china#v=onepage&#38;q=lettuce%20consumption%20in%20china&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/?id=Fo087ZxohA4C&#38;pg=PA148&#38;lpg=PA148&#38;dq=lettuce+consumption+in+china#v=onepage&#38;q=lettuce%20consumption%20in%20china&#38;f=false</a>|title=Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry|author=Simoons, Frederick J.|pages=147–148|isbn=0-8493-8804-X|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>As described around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw.

Romaine lettuce is often used for <a href="/Caesar_salad" title="Caesar salad">Caesar salads</a>, with a dressing that includes <a href="/Anchovy" title="Anchovy">anchovies</a> and eggs. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked.&#60;ref name=&#34;Katz376&#34; /&#62; The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, &#34;salads&#34; were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including <a href="/Bean_curd" title="Bean curd">bean curd</a> and meat dishes, soups and <a href="/Stir-fry" title="Stir-fry">stir-frys</a> plain or with other vegetables.
