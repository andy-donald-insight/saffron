<p>A <b>touton</b> (or <b>toutin</b>) is a type of traditional <a href="/Pancake" title="Pancake">pancake</a> commonly made in <a href="/Newfoundland_(island)" title="Newfoundland (island)">Newfoundland</a>, produced by frying bread dough on a pan with butter or pork fat&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/toutons" rel="nofollow">http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/toutons</a>{{deadlink|date=February 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; served with dark <a href="/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a> or <a href="/Corn_syrup" title="Corn syrup">corn syrup</a>. It is traditionally made from leftover bread dough. </p>
<p>Toutons are usually served at <a href="/Breakfast" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a> or <a href="/Brunch" title="Brunch">brunch</a> and can still be found quite commonly on the breakfast menus of many local restaurants. It is much rarer to find them cooked in <a href="/Fatback" title="Fatback">fatback</a> pork as modern day dietary considerations have seen an evolution to more healthy fats; the toutons found in Newfoundland restaurants are more likely fried in a combination of olive oil, clarified butter, and/or canola oil. The other very traditional accompaniment to toutons is a drizzle of molasses or pat of butter.</p>
