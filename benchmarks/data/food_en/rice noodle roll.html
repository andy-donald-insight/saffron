<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/Rice_noodle" title="Rice noodle">rice noodle</a> sheets are made from a viscous mixture of 1 cup of <a href="/Rice_flour" title="Rice flour">rice flour</a> and 1/4 cup <a href="/Tapioca" title="Tapioca">tapioca</a> or glutinous rice flour and water; this recipe will scale well as long as the ratio of flours and water remain the same. The combination of both types of flour and water should be a consistency of heavy cream. The rice flour serves as the bulk and flavor of rice, the tapioca flour gives the noodle elasticity and springiness; therefore, it should never crumble nor be too chewy. It should never have the <a href="/Al_dente" title="Al dente">al dente</a> texture as with Italian <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>. Boric acid is sometimes used to make it have a very smooth texture or plastic sheen. Boric acid is banned for human consumption as a food ingredient in the United States as it may cause kidney failure.</p>
<p>This liquid mixture is poured into a specially made flat pan with holes (similar to a flat colander). Commercial restaurants instead use special over-sized steamers that are lined with a steam permeable cloth. The noodle mixture is steamed in the pan from the bottom up to produce the square rice noodle sheets. The thickness of the noodle should be very thin (roughly about ⅛ thickness), never thick, or it will have a gummy texture.</p>
<p>Once the liquid mixture is ladled and set, the chef can add a filling such as shrimp or beef before the noodle is fully cooked. As the noodle is cooking, it will start to set around the filling and take hold without falling out when transferring from steamer to dish. After steaming for several minutes, the entire freshly steamed noodle is melded onto the cloth thereby the necessity to be scraped off with a scraper and onto a usually a metal table surface with a thin coat of oil to prevent sticking. The resulting freshly made noodle is lightly folded about three times. The resulting size is usually anywhere from 5-7 inches long by 3 inches wide. Traditionally, the noodles are  finished with the addition of a warm, sweetened <a href="/Soy_sauce" title="Soy sauce">soy sauce</a> just before serving. <i>Cheong fun</i> &#38;ndash; Cantonese\Hong Kong style is usually lightly folded (about 3 inches wide and about 5-7 inches long) when there is a filling inside, resulting in a much more pleasing look rather than a rolled up as a fruit roll up.</p>
<p>Two common Cantonese words are typically used to describe a well-made rice noodle roll: &#34;heung&#34; (香) &#38;ndash; meaning: good aroma and &#34;whaat&#34; (滑) &#38;ndash; meaning: smooth or slippery. The actual noodle by itself doesn&#39;t have much taste, it is just as bland as plain white steamed rice. The fillings and the soy sauce that accompanies it provides the bulk of the flavor. Traditional fillings are marinated fresh or dried <a href="/Shrimp" title="Shrimp">shrimp</a>, <a href="/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>(heavily mixed with rice flour), or <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> and chopped green onions. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, presentation is very important when serving <a href="/Dim_sum" title="Dim sum">dim sum</a>. The rice noodle, when fully cooked, should be slightly transparent to slightly reveal the filling. If the edges after folding are not lined up then the edges are to be cut to get that even look, similar to getting the outer crust cut off a sandwich. The rice noodle roll is generally served in &#34;threes&#34; and usually scored to reveal the filling inside. Most other countries will roll them plain with no filling inside and instead serve them with toppings and a heavy/thick sauce on top. The rice noodle roll is always served hot and fresh and accompanied with a splash of plain or flavored (fried <a href="/Shallot" title="Shallot">shallot</a>) oil to give it a nice sheen and aroma with a generous amount of warm sweet soy sauce added right before serving. Most establishments will have a slightly different flavor of sweet soy sauce such as an addition of <a href="/Hoisin_sauce" title="Hoisin sauce">hoisin sauce</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>A version of cheong fun notably absent outside of <a href="/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> is the sliced meat filling variety. This variety is typically found in street side restaurants as a meal in itself, and uses whole meat pieces, typically beef or pork, rather than ground meat. Prior to rolling the crepe, briefly blanched lettuce or romaine is added as part of the filling, giving the rolled cheong fun a crunch as well as volume.</p>
