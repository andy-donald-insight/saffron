<p><b>Ketwurst</b> is a form of <a href="/Hot_dog" title="Hot dog">hot dog</a> created in the <a href="/German_Democratic_Republic" title="German Democratic Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>. The word &#34;Ketwurst&#34; comes from a combination of <i><a href="/Ketchup" title="Ketchup">Ketchup</a></i> and <i>Wurst</i> (German for &#34;sausage&#34;).</p>
<p>Its preparation involves the heating of a special <a href="/Bockwurst" title="Bockwurst">Bockwurst</a>, larger than regular hot dogs, in water. A <a href="/Bread_roll" title="Bread roll">long roll</a> is pierced by a hot metal cylinder, which creates an appropriate sized hole. The sausage is then dunked in ketchup and put inside of the roll.</p>
<p>The Ketwurst was invented at the State Gastronomical Research Center — like the <a href="/Grilletta" title="Grilletta">Grilletta</a>, a hamburger-like meatball-in-a-bun — around 1977{{ndash}}1978. At that time, restaurants at the <a href="/Berlin_TV_Tower" title="Berlin TV Tower">Berlin TV Tower</a> were incapable of handling the large numbers of visitors, so a take-away food was needed. It is often considered the archetypical East German fast food, but until <a href="/German_reunification" title="German reunification">German reunification</a>, it was actually rarely seen outside the Berlin city center.</p>
