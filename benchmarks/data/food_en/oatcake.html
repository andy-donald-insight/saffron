<p>In Scotland, oatcakes are made on a <a href="/Griddle" title="Griddle">girdle</a> (or <i>griddle</i>, in other forms of English) or by baking rounds of oatmeal on a tray. If the rounds are large, they are sliced into <a href="/Farl" title="Farl">farls</a> before baking. Oats are one of the few grains which grow well in the north of Scotland and were, until the 20th century, the staple grain used.</p>
<p>Scottish soldiers in the 14th century carried a metal plate and a sack of oatmeal. According to contemporary accounts, one would heat the plate over fire, moisten a bit of oatmeal and make a cake to <i>&#34;comfort his stomach. Hence it is no marvel that the Scots should be able to make longer marches than other men.&#34;</i>&#60;ref name=McNeill&#62;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=Marian|title=The Scots Kitchen|year=1929|publisher=Blackie &#38; Son Ltd/Mercat Press Ltd|isbn=1-84183-070-4|page=175|edition=1993|chapter=Bannocks, Scones, and Tea-bread}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://outremer.co.uk/feasting.html" rel="nofollow">http://outremer.co.uk/feasting.html</a> |title=Feasting with Shadows |publisher=Outremer.co.uk |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The texture may vary from rough to fine depending on how the oats are ground. Oatcakes may be slightly chewy or hard depending the water content and how long they are cooked. Oatcakes were traditionally eaten with every meal as a major source of <a href="/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> in the diet. From the 19th century onwards they were commonly served to accompany soups, meat and fish dishes. Today they are sometimes eaten as an alternative to bread or toast at breakfast.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800|author=Elizabeth Foyster, Christopher A.
