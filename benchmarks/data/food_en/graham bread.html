<p><b>Graham bread</b> was invented by <a href="/Sylvester_Graham" title="Sylvester Graham">Sylvester Graham</a> in 1829 for his <a href="/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarian diet</a>. The Graham bread was high in <a href="/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">fiber</a>, made with <a href="/Sift" title="Sift">non-sifted</a> <a href="/Whole-wheat_flour" title="Whole-wheat flour">whole-wheat flour</a>.</p>
<p>Graham created a bread free from the chemical <a href="/Food_additive" title="Food additive">additives</a> that were common in <a href="/White_bread" title="White bread">white bread</a> at that time such as <a href="/Alum" title="Alum">alum</a> and <a href="/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>. He argued that these chemical additives were unwholesome in that they increased the <a href="/Libido" title="Libido">sex drive</a>, which would in turn deplete the body.</p>
<p>While Graham&#39;s specific theories on the dangers of &#34;venereal excess&#34; have no scientific footing, he was correct in his broader stance against additives as both alum and chlorine are now known to be <a href="/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a>. The use of additives by <a href="/Bakeries" title="Bakeries">bakeries</a> was a common practice during the <a href="/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> to make bread whiter in color and more commercially appealing. Refined bread was a <a href="/Status_symbol" title="Status symbol">status symbol</a> of the <a href="/Middle_class" title="Middle class">middle class</a> because of its &#34;purity and refinement&#34; in its color and was purchased, rather than home-made.</p>
