<p>A <b>tres leches cake</b> (<a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <i>pastel de tres leches</i> or <i>torta de tres leches</i>), also known as <b>pan tres leches</b> (&#34;three milks bread&#34;), is a <a href="/Sponge_cake" title="Sponge cake">sponge cake</a>—in some recipes, a <a href="/Butter_cake" title="Butter cake">butter cake</a>—soaked in three kinds of <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>: <a href="/Evaporated_milk" title="Evaporated milk">evaporated milk</a>, <a href="/Condensed_milk" title="Condensed milk">condensed milk</a>, and <a href="/Heavy_cream" title="Heavy cream">heavy cream</a>.</p>
<p>When butter is not used, the <i>Tres Leches</i> is a very light cake, with many air bubbles. This distinct texture is why it does not have a soggy consistency, despite being soaked in a mixture of three types of milk.</p>

<p>A variety of <i>tres leches</i> known as <i>trileçe</i> has recently become popular in Turkey.
