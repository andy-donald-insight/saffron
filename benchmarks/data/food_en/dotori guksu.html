<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Varieties">Varieties</span></h2>
<p>There are two varieties of acorn noodles: flour-based soba and starch-based vermicelli.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Starch-based">Starch-based</span></h3>
<p>Acorn vermicelli noodles or <i>dotori naengmyeon</i> (hangul: 냉면 도토리) are made from acorn starch and some combination of potato, rice, or <a href="/Arrowroot" title="Arrowroot">arrowroot</a> starch, wheat flour, and salt. The dried noodles resemble brown plastic threads about 1/10-1/8&#38;nbsp;cm in diameter. Cooked properly and typically eaten cold, acorn-based <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles have a high elasticity and chewy consistency.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flour-based">Flour-based</span></h3>
<p>Acorn soba noodles or in Korean, <i>dotori guksu</i> (hangul: 도토리국수) are made from acorn flour and a combination of grain-based flours; such as <a href="/Buckwheat" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a> and corn, and salt. They are about as thick as <a href="/Spaghetti" title="Spaghetti">spaghetti</a> and are used in hot and cold dishes, such as Zaru Soba (boiled noodles are served cold with a dipping sauce.) Acorn soba noodles may be more healthy than the starch-based acorn vermicelli noodles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Japanese version of these noodles, <i>donguri-men</i> (Japanese:どんぐり), typically has less acorn flour than the original Korean version.</p>
<p>Raw acorn noodles are slightly coarser in cut and texture and more brittle than standard buckwheat soba noodles. Cooked acorn soba noodles are nuttier in flavor, healthier, and slightly saltier than buckwheat noodles. In particular, they contain many antioxidants and may be considered an <a href="/Adaptogenic" title="Adaptogenic">adaptogenic</a> (anti-cancerous) food.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_starch_and_flour_bases">Differences between starch and flour bases</span></h3>
<p>A common problem among Korean-manufactured products is that their ingredient labels are often not properly translated. Acorn starch is frequently mislabeled as acorn flour or acorn powder. In reality, acorn starch is essentially highly refined acorn flour, devoid of fiber, fat, and almost all nutrition. While the acorn itself does indeed contain acorn starch, that starch is not highly refined. Acorn starch, in contrast, is extracted from the meat of the kernel using a wet process and then dehydrated. The heart, or germ, of the kernel is removed and used for producing acorn oil, which is comparable in flavor and quality to olive oil. The hull is separated from the kernel meat, and the starch is extracted from the kernel meat. It might be more accurate to use the term “acorn meal”, although a meal is a coarser, less refined version of flour.</p>
<p>Both flour and starch-based acorn noodles are available in <a href="/Luxury_good" title="Luxury good">upscale</a> Korean markets. A few Japanese markets also carry acorn soba noodles, but in general, acorn soba noodles are difficult to find.</p>
