<p><b>Depression cake</b> is a type of <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> that was commonly made during the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>.  The <a href="/Ingredient" title="Ingredient">ingredients</a> include little or no <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, butter or <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, because the ingredients were then either expensive or hard to obtain. Similar cakes are known as &#34;War Cake,&#34; as they avoided ingredients that were scarce or were being conserved for the use of soldiers.  A common Depression Cake is also known as &#34;Boiled Raisin Cake,&#34; or &#34;Milkless, Eggless, Butterless Cake.&#34;  &#34;Boiled&#34; refers to the boiling of raisins with the sugar and spices to make a syrup base early in the recipe.  However, some bakers do include butter.  Boiled raisin-type cakes date back at least to the <a href="/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |author=Jean Anderson |title=Quick Loaves: 150 Breads and Cakes, Meat and Meatless Loaves |publisher= |location= |year= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Depression cake has been referred to as “War Cake” by texts dating back to <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>.  In a pamphlet distributed by the <a href="/United_States_Food_Administration" title="United States Food Administration">United States Food Administration</a> in 1918 entitled “War Economy in Food,” War Cake is listed under “Recipes for Conservation Sweets.” The United States Food Administration stressed the importance of reducing sugar consumption during the war and offered molasses, corn syrup, and raisins in its place.&#60;ref&#62;United States Food Administration. War Economy in Food: With Suggestions and Recipes for Substitutions in the Planning of Meals, 1918.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>When the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> hit America following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, families were forced to stretch their budgets and “make do” with minimal and cheap ingredients when it came to cooking. Some women were able to feed their families on $5 per week.&#60;ref&#62;Cravens, Hamilton. Great Depression: People and Perspectives. ABC-CLIO, 2009.&#60;/ref&#62; Dessert became a luxury for most, and depression cake was a more affordable alternative to other cakes that used milk, eggs, and butter.  Affordability was achieved through ingredient substitution. For example, shortening was substituted for butter, water was substituted for milk, and baking powder was substituted for eggs.&#60;ref&#62;Swell, Barbara. Mama’s in the Kitchen: Weird &#38; Wonderful Home Cooking 1900-1950. Native Ground Books &#38; Music, 2002.&#60;/ref&#62; Depression cake is just one of many examples of ingredient substitution during the Great Depression, as some women took full advantage of the practice by making mock foods such as mock <a href="/Apple_pie" title="Apple pie">apple pie</a> and mock fish.&#60;ref&#62;Kennan Ferguson. “Intensifying Taste, Intensifying Identity: Collectivity Through Community Cookbooks.” Signs 37, no. 3 (Spring 2012): 708.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Pears were sometimes substituted for apples.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,176,156185-242204,00.html" rel="nofollow">Cooks.com - Recipe - Depression Cake&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>An example for a depression cake recipe is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 by 9 in baking pan. In a large saucepan, combine 1 cup white sugar, 2 cups firmly packed brown sugar, 2 cups water, 1 cup shortening, 4 cups seedless raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 2 tsp salt. Boil together for 3 minutes, then cool.</li>
<li>Sift together 4 cups flour, 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp baking soda. Add to saucepan, along with 2 cups chopped nuts (optional.) Mix well and pour into baking pan. Bake for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from oven. Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn onto a cake plate. When thoroughly cool, sprinkle with a little powdered sugar or mix lemon juice and grated lemon rind into powdered sugar for frosting.&#60;ref&#62;Canfield, Jack, Mark Victor Hansen, and Diana Von Welanetz Wentworth. Chicken Soup for the Soul Cookbook: 101 Stories with Recipes from the Heart. HCI, 1995.&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is one example of a depression cake recipe. Other variations may include corn syrup, molasses, brown sugar, and various fruits.  In some instances, bakers would leave the cake unfrosted or sprinkle the top with powdered sugar in lieu of icing. The interchangeability of ingredients makes the recipe for depression cake extremely versatile.</p>
