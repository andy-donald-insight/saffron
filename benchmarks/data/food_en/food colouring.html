<b>Food coloring</b>, or color additive, is any dye, pigment or substance that imparts <a href="/Color" title="Color">color</a> when it is added to <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> or <a href="/Drink" title="Drink">drink</a>. They come in many forms consisting of liquids, powders, gels, and pastes. Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking. Due to its safety and general availability, food coloring is also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects and medical devices.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation |title= CFR Title 21 Part 70: Color Additive Regulations |publisher= FDA |origyear= Mar 22 1977 |url= <a class="external free" href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=df0d2cc786cc4d2efd1ebf642c9a79fa;rgn=div5;view=text;node=21%3A1.0.1.1.24;idno=21;cc=ecfr#21:1.0.1.1.24.1.31.1" rel="nofollow">http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=df0d2cc786cc4d2efd1ebf642c9a79fa;rgn=div5;view=text;node=21%3A1.0.1.1.24;idno=21;cc=ecfr#21:1.0.1.1.24.1.31.1</a> |accessdate= Feb 15, 2012 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In the 20th century, the improvement of chemical analysis and the development of trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and the improvement of foods. This principle is called a positive listing, and almost all recent legislations are based on it.&#60;ref name=&#34;Arlt&#34; /&#62; Positive listing implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities.

<p>While naturally derived colors are not required to be certified by a number of regulatory bodies throughout the world (including the <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="Food and Drug Administration (United States)">FDA</a>), they still need to be approved for use in that country.

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/Food_coloring#Artificial_coloring" title="Food coloring">Certified colors</a></b> are synthetically produced and are used widely because they impart an intense, uniform color, are less expensive, and blend more easily to create a variety of hues.

<li>Colors that are <b><a href="/Food_coloring#Natural_food_dyes" title="Food coloring">exempt from certification</a></b> include pigments derived from natural sources such as vegetables, minerals or animals. Nature derived color additives are typically more expensive than certified colors and may add unintended flavors to foods.

<p>To ensure reproducibility, the colored components of these substances are often provided in highly purified form, and for increased stability and convenience, they can be formulated in suitable carrier materials (solid and liquids). <a href="/Hexane" title="Hexane">Hexane</a>, <a href="/Acetone" title="Acetone">acetone</a> and other <a href="/Solvents" title="Solvents">solvents</a> break down cell walls in the fruit and vegetables and allow for maximum extraction of the coloring. Traces of these may still remain in the finished colorant, but they do not need to be declared on the product label; this is because they are part of a group of substances known as carry-over ingredients.</p>
<p>Food colorants can sometimes cause allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock in sensitive individuals. Natural coloring agents known to be potential hazards include annatto, cochineal and carmine.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dyes_and_lakes">Dyes and lakes</span></h2>
<p>Color additives are available for use in food as either &#34;<a href="/Dye" title="Dye">dyes</a>&#34; or <a href="/Lake_pigments" title="Lake pigments">lake pigments</a> (commonly known as &#34;lakes&#34;).</p>
<p>Dyes <a href="/Solvation" title="Solvation">dissolve</a> in water, but are not <a href="/Solubility" title="Solubility">soluble</a> in oil. Dyes are manufactured as powders, granules, liquids or other special purpose forms. They can be used in beverages, dry mixes, baked goods, confections, dairy products, pet foods, and a variety of other products. Dyes also have side effects which lakes do not, including the fact that large amounts of dyes ingested can color stools.</p>
<p>Lakes are made by combining dyes with salts to make insoluble compounds. Lakes tint by <a href="/Dispersive_mass_transfer" title="Dispersive mass transfer">dispersion</a>. Lakes are not oil-soluble, but are oil-dispersible. Lakes are more stable than dyes and are ideal for coloring products containing fats and oils or items lacking sufficient moisture to dissolve dyes. Typical uses include coated tablets, cake and doughnut mixes, hard candies and chewing gums, lipsticks, soaps, shampoos, talc, etc.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_uses">Other uses</span></h2>
<p>Because food dyes are generally safer to use than normal artists&#39; dyes and pigments, some artists have used food coloring as a means of making pictures, especially in forms such as body-painting.
