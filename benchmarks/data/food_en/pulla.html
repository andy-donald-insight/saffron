<p><b>Pulla</b> ({{IPA-fi|ˈpulːɑ}}; Swedish <i>bulle</i> or <i>kanelbulle</i>) is a mildly-sweet <a href="/Finnish_cuisine" title="Finnish cuisine">Finnish</a> <a href="/Sweet_roll" title="Sweet roll">sweet roll</a> or dessert bread flavored with crushed <a href="/Elettaria" title="Elettaria">cardamom</a> seeds and occasionally <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a> or sliced <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a>. Braid loaves (<b>pitko</b>) are formed from three or more <a href="/Braid" title="Braid">braided</a> strands of dough. The braids may also be formed into a ring.  These braided strands or rings are typically coated with melted butter and then sprinkled with white sugar or almonds.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Finnish Pulla Recipe|url=<a class="external free" href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/finnish-pulla/detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/finnish-pulla/detail.aspx</a>|work=Allrecipes.com|publisher=Allrecipes.com|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62; Other types of pulla include small round ones that resemble English scones but have a sugar and butter topping, and larger <a href="/Cinnamon_roll" title="Cinnamon roll">cinnamon rolls</a> called <b>korvapuusti</b>. The outside typically has a shiny brown glaze, formed by a coating of <a href="/Egg_white" title="Egg white">egg white</a>, <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> or a mixture of <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> and brewed <a href="/Coffee" title="Coffee">coffee</a>.</p>
<p>There are two different variations of pulla: dark roast (<b>tummapaahto</b>) and pale (<b>kalpii</b>). &#34;Tummapaahto&#34; is baked in the oven until the sugar is darkened and melted. &#34;Kalpii&#34; is baked in the oven only for a short period of time, leaving the dough only lightly darkened.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}</p>
<p>Pitko is typically served in thin slices with coffee or at special occasions. Regular small pulla is served as a whole. Serving pulla with coffee is a very common practice in Finland.</p>
<p>Pulla is also common in the <a href="/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan" title="Upper Peninsula of Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> and <a href="/Northern_Ontario" title="Northern Ontario">Northern Ontario</a>, areas in the United States and Canada which have large Finnish populations. There it is also commonly known as <b>nisu</b>, an old Finnish word still in use with the same meaning in some dialects, despite originally simply meaning &#34;wheat&#34;.  &#34;Pulla&#34; is used instead to refer to a biscotti-like double-baked bread stick for dunking in coffee that is often made from leftover &#34;nisu&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Ojakangas, B.
