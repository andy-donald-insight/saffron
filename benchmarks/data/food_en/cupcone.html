A <b>cupcone</b> (the common <a href="/American_English" title="American English">US</a> term), is a small <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> generally proportioned to serve one person, specifically baked in a flat bottomed <a href="/Ice_cream_cone" title="Ice cream cone">ice cream cone</a>.  As with larger cakes, <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">frosting</a> and other <a href="/Cake_decorating" title="Cake decorating">cake decorations</a>, such as <a href="/Sprinkles" title="Sprinkles">sprinkles</a>, are common on cupcones. The consumable vessel design of a cupcone makes for a completely edible and self-contained snack food with no waste.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Although the origins of the recipe and the first use of the term are unclear (the origins are traced back to African American communities but exact origins are unclear), cupcones and cupcake cones have been a party favorite in recent history. The term cupcone is used to describe a cupcake product cooked in a flat bottomed ice cream cone instead of a paper cup in order to eliminate the waste paper after consumption.  Described as a way to be more earth friendly, the cupcone takes its name from the common recipe of a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as <i>1234 cakes</i> or <i>quarter cakes</i>, so called because they are made up of four ingredients in equal ratios; butter, sugar, eggs and flour. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than <a href="/Pound_cake" title="Pound cake">pound cake</a>, due to the reduced proportion of butter. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; &#34;cup cake&#34; uses a volume measurement, and &#34;pound cake&#34; uses a weight measurement.&#60;ref name=&#34;titleThe Food Timeline: cake history notes&#34;&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#poundcake" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#poundcake</a> |title=The Food Timeline: cake history notes |accessdate=2008-03-14 |format= |work=}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Cupcones can be used interchageably with cupcakes that are often served during a <a href="/Party" title="Party">celebration</a>, such as children&#39;s <a href="/Party#Birthday_party" title="Party">birthday parties</a>. Additionally, they can be served as an accompaniment to afternoon tea. Cupcones are a more convenient alternative to a full-sized cake as they don&#39;t require <a href="/Food_utensil" title="Food utensil">utensils</a> or division into individual portions.</p>
