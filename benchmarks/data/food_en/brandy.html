<p>{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
The origins of brandy were clearly tied to the development of <a href="/Distilled_beverage" title="Distilled beverage">distillation</a>. While the process was known in the classical times, it wasn&#39;t used for significant beverage production up until the 15th century.&#60;ref name=bnf&#62;{{cite book| title=Plants: Diet and Health |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FYKT8ApFnj0C&#38;pg=PA174" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=FYKT8ApFnj0C&#38;pg=PA174</a> |author=British Nutrition Foundation’s Task Force |page=174 |editor=Gail Goldberg |publisher=John Wiley &#38; Sons |year=2008 |isbn=9781405147729}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=faith&#62;{{cite book|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GNUVAgAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA56" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=GNUVAgAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA56</a> |title=Cognac: The story of the world&#39;s greatest brandy |author=Nicholas Faith |publisher=Infinite Ideas |year=2013 |isbn=9781906821791}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.rs/books?id=Fj6xh-lUJEQC&#38;pg=PA2" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.rs/books?id=Fj6xh-lUJEQC&#38;pg=PA2</a> |title=The Brandy Trade Under the Ancien Régime |author=L. M. Cullen |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780521890984}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Initially wine was distilled as a <a href="/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">preservation</a> method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in <a href="/Aging_barrel" title="Aging barrel">wooden casks</a>, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit.&#60;ref name=eb/&#62; In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.</p>
<p>As described in the 1728 edition of <i><a href="/Cyclopaedia%2C_or_an_Universal_Dictionary_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences">Cyclopaedia</a></i>, the following method was used to distill brandy:&#60;ref name=&#34;cyclo&#34;&#62;{{1728|title=Brandy}}&#60;/ref&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;A <a href="/Alembic" title="Alembic">cucurbit</a> was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called <i>spirit of wine</i> or <i>brandy</i>. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called <i>spirit of wine rectified</i>. The second distillation was made in <i><a href="/Balneo_mariae" title="Balneo mariae">balneo mariae</a></i> and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified—as long as the operator thought necessary—to produce brandy.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>To shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. To test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine, a portion was ignited. If the entire contents were consumed without leaving any impurities behind, then the liquor was good. Another, better test involved putting a little <a href="/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> in the bottom of the spirit. If the gunpowder took fire when the spirit was consumed, then the liquor was good.&#60;ref name=&#34;cyclo&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>As most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the <a href="/Black_Sea_Region" title="Black Sea Region">Black Sea region</a>, including <a href="/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, the <a href="/Crimean_Peninsula" title="Crimean Peninsula">Crimea</a>, and <a href="/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>. In 1880, David Saradjishvili founded his Cognac Factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time. Armenian and Georgian brandies, called cognacs in the era, were considered some of the best in the world and often beat their French competitors at the International Expositions in Paris and Brussels in the early 1900s. The storehouses of the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg were regarded as the largest collections of cognacs and wines in the world with much of it from the Transcaucasus region of Georgia. During the October Revolution of 1917, upon the storming of the Winter Palace, the Bolshevik Revolution actually paused for a week or so as the  participants gorged on the substantial stores of cognac and wines. The Russian market was always a huge brandy-consuming region in which home-grown varieties were common but much of it was imported. The patterns of bottles followed that of the western European norm. Throughout the Soviet era, the production of brandy was  a source of pride for the communist regime as  they continued to produce some excellent varieties, especially the most famous Jubilee Brandies of 1967, 1977, and 1987. Remaining bottles of these productions are highly sought after, not simply for their quality, but for their historical significance.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology">Technology</span></h2>
<p>Except for few major producers, brandy production and consumption tend to have a regional character and thus production methods significantly vary. Wine brandy is produced from a variety of grape cultivars. A special selection of cultivars, providing distinct aroma and character, is used for high-quality brandies, while cheaper ones are made from whichever wine is available.&#60;ref name=Oxford&#62;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA250" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA250</a> |chapter=5.2. Brandy |pages=249–252 |editor=Charles W. Bamforth, Robert E. Ward |year=2014 |isbn=9780199742707}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Brandy is made from so-called <a href="/Base_wine" title="Base wine">base wine</a>, which significantly differs from regular table wines. It is made from early grapes in order to achieve higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. It generally contains smaller amount (up to 20&#38;nbsp;mg/l) of <a href="/Sulphur" title="Sulphur">sulphur</a> than regular wines, as it creates undesired <a href="/Copper(II)_sulfate" title="Copper(II) sulfate">copper(II) sulfate</a> in reaction with copper in the <a href="/Pot_still" title="Pot still">pot stills</a>. The yeast sediment produced during the fermentation may or may not be kept in the wine, depending on the brandy style.&#60;ref name=Oxford/&#62;</p>
<p>Brandy is distilled from the base wine in two phases. In the first, large part of water and solids is removed from the base, obtaining so-called &#34;low wine&#34;, basically a concentrated wine with 28–30% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the &#34;heads&#34;, &#34;heart&#34; and &#34;tails&#34; respectively. The first part, the &#34;head,&#34; has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, &#34;tail&#34;, is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, richest in aromas and flavors, is preserved for later maturation.&#60;ref name=Oxford/&#62;</p>
<p>Distillation does not simply enhance the alcohol content of wine. The heat under which the product is distilled and the material of the still (usually copper) cause chemical reactions to take place during distillation. This leads to the formation of numerous new <a href="/Volatile_organic_compound" title="Volatile organic compound">volatile</a> aroma components, changes in relative amounts of aroma components in the wine, and the <a href="/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of components such as esters.</p>
<p>Brandy is usually produced in <a href="/Pot_still" title="Pot still">pot stills</a> (<a href="/Batch_distillation" title="Batch distillation">batch distillation</a>), but the <a href="/Column_still" title="Column still">column still</a> can also be used for <a href="/Continuous_distillation" title="Continuous distillation">continuous distillation</a>. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced.&#60;ref name=Oxford/&#62; <a href="/Cognac_(brandy)" title="Cognac (brandy)">Cognac</a> and <a href="/South_African_brandy" title="South African brandy">South African brandy</a> are examples of brandy produced in batches&#60;ref name=Oxford/&#62; while many American brandies use <a href="/Fractional_distillation" title="Fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a> in column stills.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aging">Aging</span></h3>
<p>After distillation, the unaged brandy is placed into <a href="/Oak_barrel" title="Oak barrel">oak barrels</a> to mature. Usually, brandies with a natural golden or brown colour are aged in <a href="/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> <a href="/Aging_barrel" title="Aging barrel">casks</a> (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the <a href="/Solera" title="Solera">solera</a> system, where the spirit changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.&#60;ref name=Oxford/&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumption">Consumption</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Serving">Serving</span></h3>

When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating.

<p>The European Union and some other countries legally enforce the use of &#34;Cognac&#34; as the exclusive name for brandy produced and distilled in the Cognac area of France, and the name &#34;Armagnac&#34; for brandy from the Gascony area of France. Both must also be made using traditional techniques. Since these are considered &#34;protected designation of origin&#34;, a brandy made elsewhere cannot be called Cognac in these jurisdictions, even if it were made in an identical manner.</p>

<p>Brandy has a traditional age grading system, although its use is unregulated outside of <a href="/Cognac" title="Cognac">Cognac</a> and <a href="/Armagnac_(brandy)" title="Armagnac (brandy)">Armagnac</a>. These indicators can usually be found on the label near the brand name:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>V.S.</b> (&#34;very special&#34;) or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.&#60;ref name=&#34;BNIC etiquette&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette" rel="nofollow">Website of the BNIC</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li><b>V.S.O.P.</b> (&#34;very superior old pale&#34;), <b>Reserve</b> or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.&#60;ref name=&#34;BNIC etiquette&#34;/&#62;</li>
<li><b>XO</b> (&#34;extra old&#34;) or <b>Napoléon</b> designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.&#60;ref name=&#34;BNIC etiquette&#34;/&#62; </li>
<li><b>Hors d&#39;âge</b> (&#34;beyond age&#34;) is a designation which is formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac designated brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.</li>
