<p>A <b>marble cake</b> is a <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> with a streaked or mottled appearance (like <a href="/Marble" title="Marble">marble</a>) achieved by very lightly blending light and dark <a href="/Batter_(cooking)" title="Batter (cooking)">batter</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |first=Lynne |last=Olver |date=10 May 2009 |title=Marble cake |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#marble" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#marble</a> |work=Cake History Notes |accessdate=20 May 2009}}&#60;/ref&#62; It can be a mixture of vanilla and chocolate cake, in which case it is mainly vanilla, with streaks of chocolate. Other possibilities are strawberry or other fruit flavors, or (particularly in marbled <a href="/Coffee_cake" title="Coffee cake">coffee cakes</a>) cinnamon and/or other spices.</p>
<p>The first print references to marble cake begin appearing in the last quarter of the 19th century. One popular variation of this recipe during Victorian times was “Harlequin cake,” &#60;ref&#62;Oliver, Lynne. &#34;Marble Cake.&#34; Food Timeline. N.p., 1999.
