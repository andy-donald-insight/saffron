Gamjatang originated in the southern <a href="/Korea" title="Korea">Korean</a> province of <a href="/Jeolla" title="Jeolla">Jeolla</a>. The main industry of Jeolla Province was agriculture, and hogs were widely raised and used for food. The origins of gamjatang can be traced back to the <a href="/Three_Kingdoms" title="Three Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a> Era when South Jeolla farmers raised hogs in greater numbers than in most of the rest of Korea.</p>
<p>Since cows were the backbone of farming then, used both for their milk and plowing, cows were much more valuable than hogs. Slaughtering hogs for feasts and special occasions was much more common than slaughtering cows, which helps explain the dish&#39;s pork origins.</p>
<p>When <a href="/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a> harbor opened, many people migrated to Seoul and its surrounding area from Jeolla Province, as well as from other parts of the country. When construction of the Gyung-ui Railway began in 1899, lots of laborers started working around Incheon and gamjatang become popular among them because it is cheap, nutritious, and its high fat content provided the calories they needed. As time passed, gamjatang became one of the iconic foods of <a href="/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a>.</p>
