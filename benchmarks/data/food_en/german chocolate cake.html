<p>Contrary to popular belief, German chocolate cake did not originate in <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.  Its roots can be traced back to 1852 when American Samuel German developed a type of dark baking chocolate for the American <a href="/Walter_Baker_%26_Company" title="Walter Baker &amp; Company">Baker&#39;s Chocolate Company</a>. The brand name of the product, <i>Baker&#39;s German&#39;s Sweet Chocolate</i>, was named in honor of him.</p>
<p>On June 3, 1957, a recipe for &#34;German&#39;s Chocolate Cake&#34; appeared as the &#34;Recipe of the Day&#34; in the <i><a href="/Dallas_Morning_Star" title="Dallas Morning Star">Dallas Morning Star</a></i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sammarco&#34;&#62;{{cite book | last=Sammarco  | first=Anthony Mitchell | title=The Baker Chocolate Company: A Sweet History | location=Charleston, SC | publisher=History Press | year=2009 |isbn=9781596293533  |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hJ4qLLeaQ5UC&#38;pg=PA81&#38;dq=%22george+clay%22+%22chocolate%22&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ei=MXv1UJ36Ecbe0QGZg4HgAQ&#38;ved=0CDEQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%22george%20clay%22%20%22chocolate%22&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=hJ4qLLeaQ5UC&#38;pg=PA81&#38;dq=%22george+clay%22+%22chocolate%22&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ei=MXv1UJ36Ecbe0QGZg4HgAQ&#38;ved=0CDEQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%22george%20clay%22%20%22chocolate%22&#38;f=false</a> | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62; It was created by Mrs. George Clay, a homemaker from 3831 Academy Drive, Dallas, Texas.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sammarco&#34; /&#62;  This recipe used the baking chocolate introduced 105 years prior and became quite popular. <a href="/General_Foods" title="General Foods">General Foods</a>, which owned the <a href="/Baker&#39;s_Chocolate_(brand)" title="Baker&#39;s Chocolate (brand)">Baker&#39;s brand</a> at the time, took notice and distributed the cake recipe to other newspapers in the country. Sales of Baker&#39;s Chocolate are said to have increased by as much as 73% and the cake would become a national staple. The possessive form (German&#39;s) was dropped in subsequent publications, forming the &#34;German Chocolate Cake&#34; identity and giving the false impression of a German origin.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | author= | title=Is German Chocolate Cake Really German? | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.kitchenproject.com/html/Is_German_Chocolate_Cake_Really_German.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitchenproject.com/html/Is_German_Chocolate_Cake_Really_German.html</a> | work=Kitchen Project | date=30 May 2007 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | author= Linda Stradley| title=German Chocolate Cake - History of German Chocolate Cake | url=<a class="external free" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/GermanChocolateCake.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/GermanChocolateCake.htm</a> | work=Whats Cooking America | year=2007 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | author= | title=Germanely Chocolate Cake | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.snopes.com/business/names/cake.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/business/names/cake.asp</a> | work=Snopes | date=February 21, 2007 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
