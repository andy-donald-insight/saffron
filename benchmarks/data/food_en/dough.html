<p><b>Dough</b> ({{Audio|En-us-dough.ogg|/doʊ/}}) is a thick, malleable, sometimes elastic, <a href="/Paste_(food)" title="Paste (food)">paste</a> made out of any <a href="/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereals</a> (grains), <a href="/Legume" title="Legume">leguminous</a> or <a href="/Chestnut" title="Chestnut">chestnut</a> crops. Dough is typically made by mixing <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> with a small amount of <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> and/or other liquid, and sometimes includes <a href="/Bakers_yeast" title="Bakers yeast">yeast</a> or other <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">leavening agents</a> as well as other ingredients such as various fats or flavorings.</p>
<p>The process of making and shaping dough is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">breads</a> and bread-based items, but also including <a href="/Biscuit" title="Biscuit">biscuits</a>, <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cakes</a>, <a href="/Cookies" title="Cookies">cookies</a>, <a href="/Dumpling" title="Dumpling">dumplings</a>, <a href="/Flatbread" title="Flatbread">flatbreads</a>, <a href="/Noodle" title="Noodle">noodles</a>, <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>, <a href="/Pastry" title="Pastry">pastry</a>, <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a>, <a href="/Pie" title="Pie">piecrusts</a>, and similar items.

<p>Doughs vary widely depending on ingredients, the kind of product being produced, the type of <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">leavening agent</a> (particularly whether the dough is based on yeast or not), how the dough is mixed (whether quickly mixed or <a href="/Kneading" title="Kneading">kneaded</a> and left to rise), and cooking or baking technique.

<p><a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">Pasta</a> and <a href="/Noodle" title="Noodle">noodles</a> are generally based on unleavened doughs that are worked until they are dry and smooth, and then shaped into their final form. The finished pasta may be cooked immediately or dried before cooking.</p>
<p>Doughs with higher fat content have a lesser water content, develop less gluten and are therefore generally less elastic than bread doughs; these doughs are often called &#34;short&#34; by bakers. This category includes many cookie and <a href="/Pie" title="Pie">pie</a> crust doughs, such as <a href="/Shortcrust_pastry" title="Shortcrust pastry">shortcrust pastry</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;levine&#34;/&#62;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Techniques">Techniques</span></h2>
<p>Techniques used in dough production depend on the type of dough and final product.</p>
<p>For yeast-based and sponge (such as <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a>) breads, a common production technique is the dough is mixed, kneaded, and then left to rise. Many bread doughs call for a second stage, where the dough is kneaded again, shaped into the final form, and left to rise a final time (or <a href="/Proofing_(baking_technique)" title="Proofing (baking technique)">proofed</a>) before baking.&#60;ref name=&#34;joy&#34;&#62;{{cite book|title=<a href="/Joy_of_Cooking" title="Joy of Cooking">Joy of Cooking</a>|author1=Irma S. Rombauer|author2=Marion Rombauer Becker|author3=Ethan Becker|publisher=Scribner|year=1997|isbn=0684818701|pages=738–742}}&#60;/ref&#62; Kneading is the process of working a dough to produce a smooth, elastic dough by developing <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;joy&#34;/&#62; This process is both temperature and time-dependent; temperatures that are either too hot or too cold will cause the yeast to not develop, and rising times that are either too short or too long will affect the final product.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}</p>
<p><a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">Pasta</a> is typically made from a dry dough that is kneaded and shaped, either through <a href="/Food_extrusion" title="Food extrusion">extrusion</a>, <a href="/Pasta_maker#Homemade" title="Pasta maker">rolling out</a> in a pasta machine, or stretched or shaped by hand (as for <a href="/Gnocchi" title="Gnocchi">gnocchi</a> or <a href="/Dumplings" title="Dumplings">dumplings</a>). Pasta may be cooked directly after production (so-called &#34;<a href="/Pasta#Fresh" title="Pasta">fresh pasta</a>&#34;) or dried, which renders it shelf-stable.</p>
<p>Doughs for <a href="/Biscuit" title="Biscuit">biscuits</a> and many flatbreads which are not leavened with yeast are typically mixed but not kneaded or left to rise; these doughs are shaped and cooked directly after mixing.</p>
<p>While breads and other products made from doughs are often <a href="/Baking" title="Baking">baked</a>, some types of dough-based foods are cooked over direct heat, such as <a href="/Tortilla" title="Tortilla">tortillas</a>, which are cooked directly on a <a href="/Griddle" title="Griddle">griddle</a>. <a href="/List_of_fried_dough_foods" title="List of fried dough foods">Fried dough foods</a> are also common in many cultures.</p>
