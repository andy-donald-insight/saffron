<p>A <b>TV dinner</b> (also called <b>prepackaged meal</b>, <b>ready-made meal</b>,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/jun/12/foodanddrink.features9" rel="nofollow">Ready-made meal term</a>&#60;/ref&#62; <b>ready meal</b>, <b>frozen dinner</b>, <b>frozen meal</b>, <b>microwave meal</b>) is a <a href="/Processed_food" title="Processed food">prepackaged</a> frozen or chilled <a href="/Meal" title="Meal">meal</a> that usually comes as an individual portion. It requires very little preparation and contains all the elements for a single-serving meal. A TV dinner in the USA usually consists of a cut of meat, usually beef or chicken; a vegetable, such as peas, carrots, corn, or potatoes; and sometimes a dessert, such as a brownie or apple cobbler. The entrée could also be pasta or a common type of fish, such as <a href="/Atlantic_cod" title="Atlantic cod">Atlantic cod</a>. Rice is a common side item. In Europe the meals can be more diverse, with items such as Indian or Chinese meals being common in the UK.</p>
<p>The term <i>TV dinner</i> is a <a href="/Genericized_trademark" title="Genericized trademark">genericized trademark</a> originally used for a brand of packaged meal developed in 1953 by <a href="/C.A._Swanson_%26_Sons" title="C.A.

Several smaller companies had conceived of frozen dinners earlier (see Invention section below), but the first to achieve success was Swanson. The first Swanson-brand TV Dinner was produced in the United States and consisted of a <a href="/Thanksgiving" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> meal of <a href="/Turkey_(food)" title="Turkey (food)">turkey</a>, cornbread <a href="/Stuffing" title="Stuffing">dressing</a>, frozen <a href="/Pea" title="Pea">peas</a> and <a href="/Sweet_potato" title="Sweet potato">sweet potatoes</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.swansonmeals.com/WebPortals/Default.aspx?tabid=29" rel="nofollow">Swanson TV Dinner FAQ</a> {{wayback|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.swansonmeals.com/WebPortals/Default.aspx?tabid=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.swansonmeals.com/WebPortals/Default.aspx?tabid=29</a> |date=20060908053345 }}&#60;/ref&#62; packaged in a tray like those used at the time for <a href="/Airline_meal" title="Airline meal">airline food service</a>. Each item was placed in its own compartment. The trays proved to be useful: the entire dinner could be removed from the outer <a href="/Packaging" title="Packaging">packaging</a> as a unit; the aluminum tray could be heated directly in the <a href="/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a> without any extra dishes; and one could eat the meal directly from the same tray. The product was cooked for 25 minutes at {{convert|425|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and fit nicely on a <a href="/TV_tray_table" title="TV tray table">TV tray table</a>. The original TV Dinner sold for 98 cents, and had a production estimate of 5,000 dinners for the first year. Swanson far exceeded its expectations, and ended up selling more than 10 million of these dinners in the first year of production. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}</p>
<p>The name &#34;TV dinner&#34; came from the shape of the tray it was served on.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.gastronomica.org/fall-2009/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gastronomica.org/fall-2009/</a> |last=Morton |first=Mark |title=The Shape of Food to Come |volume=9 |number=4 |pages=6–7 |date=Fall 2009 |journal=Gastronomica |accessdate=2014-10-09 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2009.9.4.6 |jstor=10.1525/gfc.2009.9.4.6 |subscription=yes}}&#60;/ref&#62; The main entrée was in a bigger compartment on one side of the tray and the vegetables lined up in smaller compartments on the other side. The arrangement was similar to that of the front panels of a 1950s television set: a screen on the left and speakers and control on the right. There were other theories about the name of the TV dinner. One reason was that early packaging featured the image of a TV set. Another was that many families would eat these in front of a TV set.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</p>
<p>Much has changed since the first TV Dinners were marketed. For instance, a wider variety of main courses – such as <a href="/Fried_chicken" title="Fried chicken">fried chicken</a>, <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a>, <a href="/Salisbury_steak" title="Salisbury steak">Salisbury steak</a> and <a href="/Mexican_cuisine" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican</a> combinations – have been introduced. Competitors such as <a href="/Banquet_Foods" title="Banquet Foods">Banquet</a> and <a href="/Morton_Frozen_Foods" title="Morton Frozen Foods">Morton</a> began offering prepackaged frozen dinners at a cheaper price than Swanson.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Other changes include:</p>

<li>1964 – Night Hawk name originated from the Night Hawk steak houses that operated in <a href="/Austin%2C_Texas" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a> from 1939 through 1994. The original &#34;diners&#34; were open all night catering to the late-night crowd.

<li>1969 – The first TV breakfasts were marketed (pancakes and sausage were the favorites). Great Starts Breakfasts and breakfast sandwiches (such as egg and Canadian bacon) followed later.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</li>
<li>1973 – The first <a href="/Swanson_Hungry-Man" title="Swanson Hungry-Man">Swanson Hungry-Man</a> dinners were marketed; these were larger portions of its regular dinner products. The American football player <a href="/Joe_Greene_(American_football)" title="Joe Greene (American football)">&#34;Mean&#34; Joe Greene</a> was its spokesman.</li>
<li>1986 – The first microwave oven-safe trays were marketed.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern-day frozen dinners tend to come in microwave-safe containers. Product lines also tend to offer a larger variety of dinner types. These dinners, also known as microwave meals, can be purchased at most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated in a microwave oven for a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediary step (such as stirring <a href="/Mashed_potato" title="Mashed potato">mashed potatoes</a> midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</p>
<p>In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, pre-prepared frozen meals first became widely available in the late 1970s.

<p>Unfrozen pre-cooked ready meals, which are merely chilled and require less time to reheat, are also popular and are sold by most supermarkets.

The production process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, vegetables and fruits are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process is referred to as blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.&#60;ref name=&#34;TV Dinner Manufacturing&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/TV-Dinner.html" rel="nofollow">TV Dinner Manufacturing</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The food undergoes a process of cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen. After the food is placed on the conveyor belt, it is sprayed with liquid nitrogen that boils as it contact the food that is undergoing freezing. This method of flash-freezing fresh foods is used to retain natural quality of the food. When the food is chilled through cryogenic freezing, small ice crystals are formed throughout the food that, in theory, can preserve the food indefinitely if stored safely. Cryogenic freezing is widely used as it is a method for rapid freezing, requires almost no dehydration, excludes oxygen thus decreasing oxidative spoilage, and causes less damage to individual freezing pieces. Due to the fact that the cost of operating cryogenic freezing is high, it is commonly used for high value food products such as TV dinners, which is a $4.5 billion industry a year that is continuing to grow with the constant introduction of new technology.&#60;ref name=&#34;TV Dinner Manufacturing&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Following this, the dinners are either covered with aluminum foil or paper, and the product is tightly packed with a partial vacuum created to ensure no evaporation takes place that can cause the food to dry out. Then the packaged dinners are placed in refrigerated storage facility, transported through a refrigerated truck, and are stored in the grocers freezer. TV dinners prepared with the aforementioned steps that is frozen and packaged properly can remain in near-perfect condition for a long time so long as it is stored at -18&#38;nbsp;°C during shipping and storage.&#60;ref name=&#34;TV Dinner Manufacturing&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>A benefit of frozen dinners is that they are usually fully cooked during preparation, and only need to be reheated by the consumer. This eliminates the possibility of undercooking by misjudging microwave powers and cooking times, although packaging warnings often state that the food must be &#34;piping hot&#34; before consumption. More recently, frozen dinners have been created that are designed to be used as a steamer, allowing rapid cooking of essentially raw ingredients (typically fish and vegetables) immediately before consumption.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}</p>
