<p>The English word for &#34;flour&#34; is originally a variant of the word &#34;<a href="/Flower" title="Flower">flower</a>&#34;. Both derive from the <a href="/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> <i>fleur</i> or <i>flour</i>, which had the literal meaning &#34;blossom&#34;, and a figurative meaning &#34;the finest&#34;. The phrase &#34;fleur de farine&#34; meant &#34;the finest part of the meal&#34;, since flour resulted from the elimination of coarse and unwanted matter from the grain during milling.&#60;ref&#62;

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Degermed_and_heat-processed_flour">Degermed and heat-processed flour</span></h3>
<p>An important problem of the <a href="/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> was the preservation of flour. Transportation distances and a relatively slow distribution system collided with natural <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">shelf life</a>. The reason for the limited shelf life is the <a href="/Fatty_acids" title="Fatty acids">fatty acids</a> of the <a href="/Cereal_germ" title="Cereal germ">germ</a>, which react from the moment they are exposed to oxygen. This occurs when grain is milled; the fatty acids oxidize and flour starts to become <a href="/Rancidification" title="Rancidification">rancid</a>.
Depending on climate and grain quality, this process takes six to nine months. In the late 19th century, this process was too short for an industrial production and distribution cycle.

Without the germ, flour cannot become rancid. Degermed flour became standard. Degermation started in densely populated areas and took approximately one generation to reach the countryside.
Heat-processed flour is flour where the germ is first separated from the endosperm and bran, then processed with steam, dry heat or <a href="/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> and blended into flour again.&#60;ref&#62;Goldkeim - Association to promote vital flour <a class="external free" href="http://www.goldkeim.com/&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldkeim.com/&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

Flour contains a high proportion of <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starches</a>, which are a subset of complex <a href="/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a> also known as <a href="/Polysaccharide" title="Polysaccharide">polysaccharides</a>. The kinds of flour used in cooking include all-purpose flour (known as plain outside North America), self-rising flour (known as self-raising outside North America), and cake flour including bleached flour. The higher the protein content the harder and stronger the flour, and the more it will produce crusty or chewy breads. The lower the protein the softer the flour, which is better for cakes, cookies, and pie crusts.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/self-rising-flour-vs-all-purpose-flour.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Different kinds of flour -Retrieved 2011-04-15&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unbleached_flour">Unbleached flour</span></h3>
<p>Unbleached flour is simply flour that has not undergone bleaching and therefore does not have the color of &#34;white&#34; flour. An example is <a href="/Graham_flour" title="Graham flour">Graham flour</a>, whose inventor, <a href="/Sylvester_Graham" title="Sylvester Graham">Sylvester Graham</a>, was against using bleaching agents, which he considered unhealthy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bleached_flour">Bleached flour</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Flour bleaching agent}}
&#34;Refined flour&#34; has had the germ and bran removed and is typically referred to as &#34;white flour&#34;. &#34;Bleached flour&#34; is any refined flour with a whitening agent added.</p>
<p>Bleached flour is artificially aged using a bleaching agent, a maturing agent, or both. A bleaching agent would affect only the carotenoids in the flour; a maturing agent affects <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> development. A maturing agent may either strengthen or weaken gluten development.</p>
<p>The four most common additives used as bleaching/maturing agents in the US at this time are:</p>
<p><a href="/Potassium_bromate" title="Potassium bromate">Potassium bromate</a> (will be listed as an ingredient/additive) - a maturing agent that strengthens gluten development. Does not bleach.</p>
<p><a href="/Benzoyl_peroxide" title="Benzoyl peroxide">Benzoyl peroxide</a> - bleaches. Does not act as a maturing agent - no effect on gluten</p>
<p><a href="/Ascorbic_acid" title="Ascorbic acid">Ascorbic acid</a> (Will be listed as an ingredient/additive, but seeing it in the ingredient list may not be an indication that the flour was matured using ascorbic acid but instead has had a small amount added as a dough enhancer) - Maturing agent that strengthens gluten development. Does not bleach.</p>
<p><a href="/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">Chlorine</a> gas - both a bleaching agent and a maturing agent, but one that weakens gluten development. Chlorination also oxidizes starches in the flour, making it easier for the flour to absorb water and swell, resulting in thicker batters and stiffer doughs. The retarded gluten formation is desirable in cakes, cookies, and biscuits as it would otherwise make them tougher and bread-like. The modification of starches in the flour allows the use of wetter doughs (making for a moister end product) without destroying the structure necessary for light fluffy cakes and biscuits.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite book| last1 = Figoni| first1 = Paula I. | title = How Baking Works| publisher = John Wiley &#38; Sons| year = 2010| page = 86| <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 0-470-39267-3| url = <a class="external free" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC</a> }}&#60;/ref&#62; Chlorinated flour allows cakes and other baked goods to set faster, rise better, the fat to be distributed more evenly, with less vulnerability to collapse.</p>
<p>Cake flour in particular is nearly always chlorinated. There is at least one flour labeled &#34;unbleached cake flour blend&#34; (marketed by King Arthur) that is not bleached, but the protein content is much higher than typical cake flour at about 9.4% protein (cake flour is usually around 6% to 8%). According to King Arthur, this flour is a blend of a more finely milled unbleached wheat flour and cornstarch, which makes a better end result than unbleached wheat flour alone (cornstarch blended with all purpose flour commonly substituted for cake flour when the latter is unavailable). The end product, however, is denser than would result from lower-protein, chlorinated cake flour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}</p>
<p>All bleaching and maturing agents (with the possible exception of ascorbic acid) have been banned in UK.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/breadflourguide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/breadflourguide.pdf</a>|title= The Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 – Guidance Notes|date= 1 June 2008|publisher= Food Standards Agency|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Bromination of flour in the US has fallen out of favor and while it is not yet actually banned anywhere, few retail flours available to the home baker are bromated anymore.</p>
<p>Many varieties of flour packaged specifically for commercial bakeries are still bromated. Retail bleached flour marketed to the home baker is now treated mostly with either peroxidation or chlorine gas. Current information from Pillsbury is that their varieties of bleached flour are treated both with benzoyl peroxide and chlorine gas. Gold Medal states that their bleached flour is treated either with benzoyl peroxide or chlorine gas, but there is no way to tell which process has been used when buying the flour at the grocery store.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plain_flour">Plain flour</span></h3>
<p>Flour that does not have a leavening agent is called plain or all-purpose flour. It is appropriate for most bread and pizza bases. Some biscuits are also prepared using this type of flour. Bread flour is high in gluten protein, with 12.5-14% protein compared to 10-12% protein in all-purpose flour. The increased protein binds to the flour to entrap <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> released by the yeast <a href="/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermentation</a> process, resulting in a stronger rise.</p>

Self-rising (or self-raising) flour is sold premixed with chemical leavening agents. The added ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the flour which aids a consistent rise in baked goods. This flour is generally used for preparing scones, biscuits, muffins, etc. It was invented by <a href="/Henry_Jones_(baker)" title="Henry Jones (baker)">Henry Jones</a> and patented in 1845.

<p>In some markets, the different available flour varieties are labeled according to the ash mass (&#34;mineral content&#34;) that remains after a sample is incinerated in a <a href="/Laboratory_oven" title="Laboratory oven">laboratory oven</a> (typically at 550&#38;nbsp;°C or 900&#38;nbsp;°C, see <a href="/International_standard" title="International standard">international standards</a> <a href="/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a> 2171 and <a href="/International_Association_for_Cereal_Science_and_Technology" title="International Association for Cereal Science and Technology">ICC</a> <a class="external text" href="http://www.icc.or.at/standard_methods/104.1" rel="nofollow">104/1</a>). This is an easily verified indicator for the fraction of the whole grain remains in the flour, because the mineral content of the starchy endosperm is much lower than that of the outer parts of the grain. Flour made from all parts of the grain (extraction rate: 100%) leaves about 2&#38;nbsp;g ash or more per 100 g dry flour. Plain white flour (extraction rate: 50–60%) leaves only about 0.4&#38;nbsp;g.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>German</b> flour type numbers (<i>Mehltypen</i>) indicate the amount of ash (measured in milligrams) obtained from 100 g of the dry mass of this flour. Standard wheat flours (defined in <a href="/DIN" title="DIN">DIN</a> 10355) range from type 405 for normal white wheat flour for baking, to strong bread flour types 550, 812, and the darker types 1050 and 1600 for wholegrain breads.</li>
<li><b>French</b> flour type numbers (<i>type de farine</i>) are a factor 10 smaller than those used in Germany, because they indicate the ash content (in milligrams) per 10 g flour. Type 55 is the standard, hard-wheat white flour for baking, including puff pastries (&#34;pâte feuilletée&#34;). Type 45 is often called pastry flour, and is generally from a softer wheat (this corresponds to what older French texts call &#34;farine de gruau&#34;). Some recipes use Type 45 for croissants, for instance,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.supertoinette.com/fiche-cuisine/423/farine-de-ble.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.supertoinette.com/fiche-cuisine/423/farine-de-ble.html</a> |title=Supertoinette page in French on flour types |publisher=Supertoinette.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&#60;/ref&#62; although many French bakers use Type 55 or a combination of Types 45 and 55.&#60;ref&#62;The author of this phrase has studied baking in France but has no online link to cite for this.&#60;/ref&#62; Types 65, 80, and 110 are strong bread flours of increasing darkness, and type 150 is a wholemeal flour.</li>
<li><b>Czech</b> flour types describes roughness of milling instead of amount of ash, though sometimes a numbering system is used, it is not a rule. Czechs determine following four basic types of mill: Extra soft wheat flour (Výběrová hladká mouka / 00), Soft wheat flour (Hladká mouka / T650), Fine wheat flour (Polohrubá mouka), Rough wheat flour (Hrubá mouka) and Farina wheat flour (Pšeničná krupice)</li>
<li><b>Polish</b> flour type numbers, as is the case in Germany, indicate the amount of ash in 100 g of the dry mass of the flour. Standard wheat flours (defined by the <a href="/Polish_Committee_for_Standardization" title="Polish Committee for Standardization">PKN</a> in PN-A-74022:2003) range from type 450 to 2000.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%85ka">Polish Wikipedia entry on flour number types</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
</ul>

<p>In the United States and the United Kingdom, no numbered standardized flour types are defined, and the ash mass is only rarely given on the label by flour manufacturers. However, the legally required standard nutrition label specifies the protein content of the flour, which is also a way for comparing the extraction rates of different available flour types.</p>
<p>In general, as the extraction rate of the flour increases, so do both the protein and the ash content. However, as the extraction rate approaches 100% (whole meal), the protein content drops slightly, while the ash content continues to rise.</p>
<p>The following table shows some typical examples of how protein and ash content relate to each other in wheat flour:</p>

<p>This table is only a rough guideline for converting bread recipes. Since flour types are not standardized in many countries, the numbers may differ between manufacturers. Note that there is no Type 40 French flour. The closest is Type 45.</p>
<p>It is possible to determine ash content from some US manufacturers. However, US measurements are based on wheat with a 14% moisture content. Thus, a US flour with 0.48% ash would approximate a French Type 55. For US bakers of French pastry seeking an equivalent, for example, they could look at tables published by <a href="/King_Arthur_Flour" title="King Arthur Flour">King Arthur Flour</a>, showing their all-purpose flour is a close equivalent to French Type 55.</p>
