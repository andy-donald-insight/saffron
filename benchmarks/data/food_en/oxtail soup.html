<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chinese_oxtail_soup">Chinese oxtail soup</span></h2>
<p>Though translated literally as a soup (牛尾汤 niú-wěi-tāng), this version of the dish is somewhere between a  <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> and a <a href="/Stew" title="Stew">stew</a>. One of the defining characteristics of oxtail soup is that it contains a large mass of solid ingredients, rather than ingredients that have been diced or shredded as is the norm with Chinese soup. Chunks of oxtail, potato, carrots, cabbage, tomato, and mushrooms are mixed in water, and salted to taste. The mixture should be heated at a slow boil, to allow time for the ingredients to release their flavors. In particular, the tomatoes and potatoes should largely disintegrate into the water, giving the broth a reddish-orange coloration and thickening it. As to be expected, oils from the oxtail lend most of the flavor. The soup is served with all of the ingredients.</p>
