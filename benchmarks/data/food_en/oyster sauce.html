<p>The development of oyster sauce is often credited to Lee Kam Sheung, from Nam Shui Village, <a href="/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;home.lkk&#34;&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061016104631/http://home.lkk.com/product/vcd_invention.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Lee made his living running a small eatery that sold cooked oysters. The <a href="/Lee_Kum_Kee" title="Lee Kum Kee">Lee Kum Kee</a> company gives an accounting of the invention of the sauce as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dd>One day, Lee Kam Sheung was cooking oyster as usual, but he lost track of time until he smelt a strong aroma. Lifting the lid of the pot, he noticed that the normally clear oyster soup had turned into a thick, brownish sauce which astonished him with the most fragrant smell and unique, delicious taste. He started to sell this new invention which turned out to be very popular. So in 1888, he formed Lee Kum Kee to mass produce oyster sauce for sale.&#60;ref name=&#34;home.lkk&#34;/&#62;</dd>
</dl>

<p>Traditionally, oyster sauce is made by slowly simmering oysters in water until the juices caramelise into a thick, brown, intensely flavourful sauce. Today, many shortcuts have been made to create a similar flavor more quickly and at reduced cost. Oyster sauces today are usually made with a base of sugar and salt and thickened with corn starch. Oyster extracts or essences are then used to give flavour to the base sauce. Other ingredients, such as soy sauce and MSG may also be added to deepen the flavour and add colour. The quality of the oyster sauce will greatly affect the flavour.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Moncel|first=Bethany|title=What is Oyster Sauce?|url=<a class="external free" href="http://foodreference.about.com/od/Ethnic_Ingredients/a/What-Is-Oyster-Sauce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://foodreference.about.com/od/Ethnic_Ingredients/a/What-Is-Oyster-Sauce.htm</a>|publisher=About.com|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Oyster sauce adds a savory flavour to many dishes, making it an ideal choice for flavouring meat and vegetables. The sauce is a staple for much Chinese family-style cooking. It is commonly used in noodle stir-fries, such as chow mein. It is also found in popular Chinese-American dishes such as beef with stir-fried vegetables. Oyster sauce can also be used as a topping for some dishes.</p>

<p>&#34;True&#34; oyster sauce of good quality should be made by condensing oyster extracts, the white broth produced by boiling oysters in water. This <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opacity">opaque</a> broth, similar to the colour of clam juice found in supermarkets, is then <a href="/Reduction_(cooking)" title="Reduction (cooking)">reduced</a> until a desired <a href="/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> has been reached and the liquid has caramelized to a brown colour.&#60;ref name=&#34;home.lkk&#34; /&#62; No other additives, not even <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a>, should be added to the sauce, since the oysters should provide all the savoury flavour.

<p>The joint Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) said it had taken emergency action to amend its food standards code to set a limit for 3-MCPD in soy sauce of 0.02 milligrams per kilogram, in line with European Commission standards which came into force in the EU in April 2002.</p>
<p>Britain&#39;s Food Standards Agency (FSA) singled out brands and products imported from Thailand, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Brands named in the British warning include Golden Mountain, King Imperial, Pearl River Bridge, Jammy Chai, Lee Kum Kee, Golden Mark, <a href="/Kimland_Foods" title="Kimland Foods">Kimlan</a>, Golden Swan, Sinsin, Tung Chun and Wanjasham soy sauce.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}</p>
<p>In July 2001, the FSA issued another statement clearing Lee Kum Kee&#39;s name after the company produced laboratory certificates from accredited, reputable laboratories. These certificates show that Lee Kum Kee products now comply with the proposed EU limit for 3-MCPD.
