<p>The use of marshmallow to make sweets dates back to <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, where the recipe called for extracting sap from the plant and mixing it with nuts and honey. Another pre-modern recipe uses the pith of the marshmallow plant, rather than the sap. The stem was peeled back to reveal the soft and spongy pith, which was boiled in sugar syrup and dried to produce a soft, chewy confection.&#60;ref name = Rohde/&#62; The marshmallow plant&#39;s sap was also used by <a href="/Gladiators" title="Gladiators">gladiators</a> in <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a>. The sap was rubbed on the body in preparation for the fight.</p>

<p>Confectioners in early 19th century France pioneered the innovation of whipping up the marshmallow sap and sweetening it, to make a confection similar to modern marshmallow. The confection was made locally, however, by the owners of small sweet shops. They would extract the sap from the mallow plant&#39;s root, and whip it themselves. The candy was very popular, but its manufacture was labour-intensive. In the late 19th century, French manufacturers thought of using egg whites or <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a>, combined with <a href="/Modified_corn_starch" title="Modified corn starch">modified corn starch</a>, to create the chewy base. This avoided the labour-intensive extraction process, but it did require industrial methods to combine the gelatin and corn starch in the right way.&#60;ref name = Rohde/&#62;&#60;ref name = Candy&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.candyusa.com/AllAboutCandy/CandyType.cfm?ItemNumber=932" rel="nofollow">The history of marshmallows</a> Candy USA!&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Another milestone in the development of the modern marshmallow was the <a href="/Food_extrusion" title="Food extrusion">extrusion</a> process by the American Alex Doumak in 1954. Marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form long continuous &#34;ropes&#34; of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today&#39;s marshmallow. In today’s modern marshmallow processing plants the following process may be used to make marshmallows in large quantities. In large industrial kettles, water, sugar, and corn syrup are heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped to another kettle to cool. Rehydrated gelatin is added and blended in once the mixture has cooled enough to not “kill” the gelatin. To give the marshmallow its fluffiness it is pumped through a blender while air is pumped into it. At this point it still needs to be cooled down further, so it will hold its shape when extruded, it is pumped through a heat exchanger prior to being pumped through the extrusion heads and onto a wide conveyor belt. The conveyor belt is coated in corn starch and more corn starch is dusted onto the top of the marshmallow extrusion as it passes down the conveyor. A large knife the width of the conveyor is located at the end of this conveyor table that will then chop the extrusion into the size marshmallow desired. The pieces will then be tumbled in corn starch in a large drum in order for the marshmallow to form its familiar skin and allow pieces that didn’t get cut all the way to break apart.&#60;ref name = Candy/&#62;</p>
<p>Marshmallows, like most sweets, are sweetened with sucrose. They are currently prepared by the aeration of mixtures of sucrose and proteins to a final density of about 0.5 g/<a href="/Milliliter" title="Milliliter">ml</a>.  The proteins, and gelatin or egg albumin, prevent the collapse of the air-filled cells.&#60;ref name=Ullmann&#62;Terry Richardson, Geert Andersen, &#34;Confectionery&#34; in Ullmann&#39;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07 411}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The traditional marshmallow recipe uses powdered marshmallow root, but most commercially manufactured marshmallows instead use <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> in their manufacture. Vegetarians and <a href="/Veganism" title="Veganism">vegans</a> avoid gelatin, but there are versions which substitute non-meat gelling agents such as <a href="/Agar" title="Agar">agar</a>. Marshmallows are also generally not considered to be <a href="/Kosher" title="Kosher">kosher</a> or <a href="/Halal" title="Halal">halal</a> unless their gelatin is derived from kosher or halal animals, or the marshmallows are vegetarian.</p>
<p><a href="/Marshmallow_creme" title="Marshmallow creme">Marshmallow creme</a> and other less firm marshmallow products generally contain little or no gelatin, which mainly serves to allow the familiar marshmallow <a href="/Confection" title="Confection">confection</a> to retain its shape.
