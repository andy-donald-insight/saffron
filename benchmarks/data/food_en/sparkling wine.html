<p>The British were the first to see the tendency of wines from Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait and tried to understand why it produced bubbles. Wine was often transported to England in <a href="/Oak_(wine)" title="Oak (wine)">wooden wine barrels</a> where merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, <a href="/Early_modern_glass_in_England" title="Early modern glass in England">English glass production</a> used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than the wood-fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of <a href="/Cork_(material)" title="Cork (material)">cork</a> stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries after the <a href="/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire" title="Fall of the Western Roman Empire">fall of the Western Roman Empire</a>. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the <a href="/Fermentation_(wine)" title="Fermentation (wine)">fermentation</a> process was prematurely halted—leaving some <a href="/Residual_sugar" title="Residual sugar">residual sugar</a> and dormant <a href="/Yeast_(wine)" title="Yeast (wine)">yeast</a>. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly. In 1662, the English scientist <a href="/Christopher_Merret" title="Christopher Merret">Christopher Merret</a> presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling and that by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it, nearly any wine could be made to sparkle. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and even suggests that British merchants were producing &#34;sparkling Champagne&#34; before the French Champenois were deliberately making it.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stevenson pg 169-178&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Viticultural" title="Viticultural">viticultural</a> and <a href="/Winemaking" title="Winemaking">winemaking</a> practices of making sparkling wine have many similarities to the production of still wine with some noted divergence. At the vineyard, grapes are <a href="/Harvested_(wine)" title="Harvested (wine)">harvested</a> early when there is still high <a href="/Acid_levels_(wine)" title="Acid levels (wine)">acid levels</a>. In areas like Australia, winemakers aim to harvest the grapes at 17 to 20° <a href="/Brix" title="Brix">brix</a>. Unlike still wine production, high <a href="/Sugar_levels_(wine)" title="Sugar levels (wine)">sugar levels</a> are not ideal and grapes destined for sparkling wine production may be harvested at higher <a href="/Yields_(wine)" title="Yields (wine)">yields</a>. Care is taken to avoid tannins and other <a href="/Phenolic_compounds_(wine)" title="Phenolic compounds (wine)">phenolic compounds</a> with many premium producers still choosing to harvest by hand rather than risk mechanical harvesting which may split the berries and encourage <a href="/Maceration_(wine)" title="Maceration (wine)">maceration</a> between the skins and juice. The press house is often close by the vineyard to where the grapes can be quickly <a href="/Pressed_(wine)" title="Pressed (wine)">pressed</a> and separated from their skins. Red wine grapes like <a href="/Pinot_noir" title="Pinot noir">Pinot noir</a> can be used in the production of white sparkling wines because their juice is initially clear and is only later <a href="/Color_(wine)" title="Color (wine)">tinted red</a> through exposure to the color pigments in grape skins. While some skin exposure may be desirable in the production of <a href="/Ros%C3%A9" title="Rosé">rosé</a> sparkling wines and some <i>blanc de noirs</i> (white of blacks), most sparkling wine producers take extended precautions to limit the amount of skin contact.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 656-660&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The primary <a href="/Fermentation_(wine)" title="Fermentation (wine)">fermentation</a> of sparkling wine begins like most other wines, though winemakers may choose to use specially cultivated sparkling wine <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeasts</a>. The wines may go through <a href="/Malolactic_fermentation" title="Malolactic fermentation">malolactic fermentation</a>, though producers wishing to make fruitier, simpler wines will usually forgo this step. After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a <i><a href="/Cuvee" title="Cuvee">cuvee</a></i>. While there are examples of <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varietal</a> sparkling wines, such as <i>blanc de blancs</i> (white of whites) made from 100% <a href="/Chardonnay" title="Chardonnay">Chardonnay</a>, most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and <a href="/Vintage" title="Vintage">vintages</a>. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the &#34;house style&#34; of their non-vintage wine. It is through the initiation of a <a href="/Secondary_fermentation_(wine)" title="Secondary fermentation (wine)">secondary fermentation</a> that distinguishes sparkling wine production and gives the wine its characteristic &#34;bubbles&#34;. One of the by products of fermentation is the creation of carbon dioxide gas. While this gas is able to be released during the first fermentation, efforts are taken during the second fermentation to retain the gas and have it dissolve into the wine. This creates a high pressure within the wine bottle (on average around 5 <a href="/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">atmospheres</a>) and wine producers take care to package the wine in strong glass bottles. When the wine is open and poured into a glass, the gas is released and the wine becomes sparkling.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 656-660&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>
There are several methods used to carry out this secondary fermentation. The most well known is the <i>Traditional</i> or <i>&#34;Champagne method&#34;</i> where the base <i>cuvee</i> is bottled with a mixture of sugar and yeast. The introduction of a fresh yeast and food source (the sugar) triggers the fermentation process in the bottle that the wine will eventually be sold in. Through the process of <a href="/Riddling" title="Riddling">riddling</a> and eventually <a href="/Disgorging" title="Disgorging">disgorgement</a>, the dead yeast cells (<a href="/Lees_(wine)" title="Lees (wine)">lees</a>) are removed from the wine while still maintaining the dissolved carbon dioxide gas. A <a href="/Sparkling_wine_production" title="Sparkling wine production">dosage</a> mixture of fresh wine and some sugar syrup is used to adjust the sweetness level of the wine after it has been disgorged.</p>
<p>In the <i>methode ancestrale</i> the disgorgement step is skipped and the wine is sold with the lees still present as sediment in the wine. In the <i>transversage</i> method, after the wines have gone through the traditional method including riddling and disgorgement, the bottles are emptied into a large tank where they are then transferred to small and large format <a href="/Wine_bottle" title="Wine bottle">wine bottles</a> such as 3 liter <i>jeroboam</i> and small split sizes used on airlines.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 656-660&#34;/&#62;  Numerous quality producers worldwide use the &#34;Traditional&#34; method to make their sparkling wines.</p>
<p>The <i>Charmat method</i> takes place in stainless steel fermentation tanks that are pressurized. The fresh yeast and sugar mixture is added to the wine which rapidly stimulates fermentation in the pressurized environment. The wine is then cooled, <a href="/Clarified_(wine)" title="Clarified (wine)">clarified</a> and bottled using a counter pressure filler. The process of carbon injection (or carbonation), the method used to make <a href="/Soda_pop" title="Soda pop">soda pop</a> fizzy, does not involve initiating a secondary fermentation but rather injecting carbon dioxide gas directly into the wine. This method produces large bubbles that quickly dissipate and is generally only used in the cheapest sparkling wines.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 656-660&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bubbles">Bubbles</span></h3>
<p>{{see also|Carbonation}}
An initial burst of effervescence occurs when the sparkling wine contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate <a href="/Nucleation" title="Nucleation">nucleation</a>.
Nucleations are needed to stimulate the formation of bubbles because carbon dioxide has to first diffuse from the wine solution before it can rise out of the glass and into the air. A poured glass of sparkling wine will lose its bubbliness and carbon dioxide gas much more quickly than an open bottle alone would.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 272-273&#34;&#62;J.

<p>The most well known example of sparkling wine is that of Champagne from the <a href="/Champagne_wine_region" title="Champagne wine region">Champagne wine region</a> of France.

French sparkling wines made according to the Champagne method of fermentation in the bottle, but sometimes use different grape varieties, are known as <i>Cremants</i> and are governed under their own <i><a href="/Appellation_d&#39;origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e" title="Appellation d&#39;origine contrôlée">Appellation d&#39;origine contrôlée</a></i> (AOC) regulations. Another style of sparkling wine found in France are those made according to the <i>methode ancestrale</i> which skips the process of disgorgement and produces wines with slight sweetness and still containing the particles of dead yeast matter in the form of lees in the bottle.

Champagne is produced at the far extreme of viticultural circumstances, where the <a href="/Grape_struggles_to_ripen" title="Grape struggles to ripen">grape struggles to ripen</a> in a long drawn out growing season. Cool climate weather limits the varieties of grape, and the types of wine that can be made, but it is in this region that sparkling wine has found its standard bearer. The <a href="/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a>–<a href="/Chalk" title="Chalk">chalk</a> soil produces grapes that have a certain balance of acidity, <a href="/Extract_(wine)" title="Extract (wine)">extract</a> and richness that is difficult to replicate in other parts of the world. The Champenois vigorously defend use of the term &#34;Champagne&#34; to relate the specific wine produced in the Champagne wine region. This includes objection to the term &#34;Champagne style&#34; to refer to sparkling wines produced outside the Champagne region. Since 1985, use of the term <i>methode champenoise</i> has been banned in all wines produced or sold in the European Union.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stevenson pg 169-178&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Blending is the hallmark of Champagne wine, with most Champagnes being the assembled product of several vineyards and vintages. In Champagne there are over 19,000 vineyard owners, only 5,000 of which are owned by Champagne producers. The rest sell their grapes to the various Champagne houses, <i><a href="/Negociants" title="Negociants">negociants</a></i> and co-operatives. The grapes, most commonly Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, are used to make several base wines that are assembled together to make Champagne. Each grape adds its own unique imprint to the result. Chardonnay is prized for its finesse and <a href="/Aging_ability_(wine)" title="Aging ability (wine)">aging ability</a>. Pinot noir adds <a href="/Body_(wine)" title="Body (wine)">body</a> and fruit while Pinot meunier contributes substantially to the <a href="/Aroma_(wine)" title="Aroma (wine)">aroma</a>, adding fruit and floral notes. The majority of Champagnes produced are non-vintage (or rather, multi-vintage) blends. Vintage Champagne, often a house&#39;s most prestigious and expensive wine, is also produced, but only in years when the producers feel that the grapes have the complexity and richness to warrant it.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stevenson pg 169-178&#34;/&#62;</p>

Sparkling wines designated Crémant (&#34;creamy&#34;) were originally named because their lower carbon dioxide pressures were thought to give them a creamy rather than fizzy mouth-feel.

As noted above, the designation Crémant was previously used for sparkling wines from the Champagne region which were produced with slightly less carbon dioxide and somewhat lower bottle pressure (typically 2–3 atmospheres instead of 5–6).&#60;ref name=&#34;OCW Cremant&#34;/&#62; These wines were rare in comparison to regular, full-pressure Champagne. The Crémant designation was also used for sparkling wines from the Loire valley, in the form of Crémant de Saumur and Crémant de <a href="/Vouvray_wine" title="Vouvray wine">Vouvray</a>, without being defined as separate appellations. In 1975, Crémant de Loire was given formal recognition as an AOC, and was followed by Crémant de Bourgogne (1975) and Crémant d&#39;Alsace (1976). When in the late 1980s lobbying by Champagne producers led to <i>méthode champenoise</i> being forbidden within the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> as a designation for the traditional method, the term Crémant was given its present definition. This meant that the use of &#34;Crémant&#34; in the Champagne region was discontinued and additional French Crémant AOCs were created from 1990, starting with Bordeaux and Limoux.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Luxembourg_wine" title="Luxembourg wine">Luxembourg</a>, Crémant de Luxembourg is a designation within the <i>Moselle Luxembourgeoise</i> appellation, rather than a separate appellation, but otherwise follow the same rules as French Crémant.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.ivv.public.lu/anbaugebiet/produkte/cremant/index.html" rel="nofollow">Institut Viti-Vinicole Grand Duché de Luxembourg: Cremant</a>, accessed on 1 April 2008&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Since the designation Crémant is not reserved exclusively for French use (as a result of it replacing <i>méthode champenoise</i>), it may also be used by producers in other EU countries which fulfill the production criteria, although such usage is rare.</p>

<a href="/Espumante" title="Espumante">Espumante</a> ({{IPA-pt|ɨʃpuˈmɐ̃t(ɨ)}}) is the Portuguese version of a sparkling wine. Unlike Cava, which is produced solely in northern climates, Espumante is not only produced in the northern wet region of Vinho Verde, but also throughout Portugal all the way to the southern region of the Alentejo, known for its extreme temperatures and arid climate.</p>
<p>While Spain has one regulating body, DOC Cava, spread across several different political regions, quality Espumante is produced solely in DOC Bairrada, located just south of Vinho Verde. In order for a wine to be certified as a quality Espumante from DOC Bairrada, it must be made in the traditional champagne (indicating the year of harvest) and stamped with the VEQPRD (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade Produzido em Região Determinada) certification.</p>

The Franciacorta region, located northwest of <a href="/Brescia" title="Brescia">Brescia</a>, is home to the largest segment of Italian sparkling wine production. Made predominately from Chardonnay and <a href="/Pinot_blanc" title="Pinot blanc">Pinot bianco</a>, sparkling wine labeled under the Franciacorta DOCG is permitted to include no more than 15% Pinot nero. Both vintage and non-vintage Franciacorta sparkling wines are made which require 30 and 18 months, respectively, of aging on the lees.&#60;ref name=wofw-franc/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Dummies pg 95-98&#34;&#62;M.

<p>Trento DOC is an appellation for white and rosé sparkling wines made according to the méthode traditionnelle. Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc and Pinot Meunier grapes are used. There is a maximum vien yield of 150 q.l. per hectare for all varietals, and a maximum grape yield of 70%. The wines must rest for a minimum of 15 months on their lees for non-vintage, 24 months for vintage, and 36 for riserva. Minimum alcohol content must be of 11.5%, or 12% for riserva. Trento DOC wines are distinguished by their straw-yellow color.</p>

<p><b>Sekt</b> is a German term for some sparkling wine. The majority of Sekt produced (around 95%) is made by the Charmat method with the remaining premium Sekt being made according to the <i>méthode traditionnelle</i>. Cheap sparkling wine made with CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; injection must not be called Sekt, but rather <i>Schaumwein</i> (German for sparkling wine, literally &#34;foam wine&#34;), semi-sparkling wine is called <i>Perlwein</i>.  Around 90 percent of Sekt is made at least partially from imported wines from <a href="/Italy_(wine)" title="Italy (wine)">Italy</a>, <a href="/Spain_(wine)" title="Spain (wine)">Spain</a> and <a href="/France_(wine)" title="France (wine)">France</a>. Sekt labeled as <i>Deutscher Sekt</i> is made exclusively from German grapes, and <i>Sekt b.A.</i> (<i>bestimmter Anbaugebiete</i>, in parallel to <i><a href="/QbA" title="QbA">Qualitätswein b.A.</a></i>) only from grapes from one of the 13 quality wine regions in Germany.</p>
<p>Some of the premium wines are often made using the <a href="/Riesling" title="Riesling">Riesling</a>, <a href="/Pinot_blanc" title="Pinot blanc">Pinot blanc</a>, <a href="/Pinot_gris" title="Pinot gris">Pinot gris</a> and <a href="/Pinot_noir" title="Pinot noir">Pinot noir</a> grapes, with much of it drunk locally rather than exported.

In Austria, the corresponding term is <i>Hauersekt</i>.</p>
<p>German production of sparkling wines dates back to 1826, when G. C. Kessler &#38; Co. was founded in <a href="/Esslingen_am_Neckar" title="Esslingen am Neckar">Esslingen am Neckar</a> by <a href="/Georg_Christian_Kessler" title="Georg Christian Kessler">Georg Christian Kessler</a> (1787–1842), who had previously worked at the Champagne house <a href="/Veuve_Clicquot" title="Veuve Clicquot">Veuve Clicquot</a> from 1807 to 1826. The names used by the German producers for their sparkling wines in the 19th century were &#34;Mousseux&#34;, &#34;Sect&#34; or &#34;Champagne&#34; (or <i>Champagner</i>), but the 1919 <a href="/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> forbade Germany the use of this name, long before European Union regulations prohibited its use outside the Champagne region. Sekt was initially an informal German name for sparkling wine, coined in Berlin 1825, but was in common use by the 1890s. Germany long attempted to have the name Sekt reserved for sparkling wine from countries with German as an official language, but these regulations were annulled by the <a href="/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a> in 1975. Another legal decision in the 1970s abolished the large producers&#39; monopoly on Sekt production, allowing <a href="/Winemaking_cooperative" title="Winemaking cooperative">winemaking cooperatives</a> and individual winegrowers to produce and sell their own sparkling wines. Together, these two decision produced the situation of the name Sekt being possible to apply to sparkling wines of varying quality level.</p>
<p>Sekt typically comes with elaborate enclosure (safety cage) to withstand its considerable CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; pressure. It also comes with a <i>Schaumwein</i> tax, which since 2005 has been 136 euro per hectoliter, corresponding to 1.02 euro per 0.75 liter bottle.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://bundesrecht.juris.de/schaumwzwstg/__2.html" rel="nofollow">Bundesministerium der Justiz: Gesetz zur Besteuerung von Schaumwein und Zwischenerzeugnissen, § 2 Steuertarif</a>, accessed on 17 May 2008&#60;/ref&#62; This tax was famously introduced by <a href="/Wilhelm_II%2C_German_Emperor" title="Wilhelm II, German Emperor">Emperor Wilhelm II</a> in 1902 to fund the expansion of the <a href="/Kaiserliche_Marine" title="Kaiserliche Marine">Imperial Navy</a>.</p>

The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and semi-dry versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made semi-sweet version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.</p>

<p>Commercial production of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England started in the 1960s, although there has been a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased.

Sparkling wines produced in the United States can be made in both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as <a href="/Andr%C3%A9_(wine)" title="André (wine)">André</a>, <a href="/Cook&#39;s_(wine)" title="Cook&#39;s (wine)">Cook&#39;s</a>, and <a href="/Tott&#39;s" title="Tott&#39;s">Tott&#39;s</a>, often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former.

<p>While many top American sparkling wine producers utilize the traditional methods of production, there are distinct differences in their <a href="/Wine_making" title="Wine making">wine making</a> techniques that have a considerable effect on the taste of the wines. In Champagne, the <a href="/Cuv%C3%A9e" title="Cuvée">cuvée</a> blend will rarely have less than 30 wines and sometimes as many as 60 that are taken from grapes spanning 4–6 years of different <a href="/Vintage" title="Vintage">vintages</a>. In California, cuvees are typically derived from around 20 wines taken from 1 to 2 years worth of vintages.  Champagne laws require that the wine spend a minimum of 15 months on the <a href="/Lees_(fermentation)" title="Lees (fermentation)">lees</a> for non-vintage and minimum 3 years for vintage Champagne. It is not uncommon for a premium Champagne to age for 7 years or more prior to release. In the US, there are no minimum requirements, and aging length can vary from 8 months to 6 years. Another distinct difference, particularly in Californian sparkling wines, is the favorable Californian climate which allows a vintage wine to be produced nearly every year.&#60;ref name=&#34;MacNeil pg 652-655&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Current US regulations ban the use of the term “champagne” on any wines not produced in Champagne except if the label was in use before 2006.  No new labels including the term “champagne” will be approved by the US Government for wines produced outside of the Champagne region of France after 2006. Those “grandfathered labels” can only use the term on a wine label if there appears next to that name the appellation of “the actual place of origin”.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=US Code Collection [Section 5388(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code &#34;Section 5388(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code&#34;]

Fully sparkling wines, such as Champagne, are generally sold with 5 to 6 <a href="/Atmospheres_(unit)" title="Atmospheres (unit)">atmospheres</a> of pressure in the bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German <i>Sekt</i>, Spanish <i>Espumoso</i>, Italian <i>Spumante</i> and French <i>Cremant</i> or <i>Mousseux</i> wines. Semi-sparkling wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German <i>spritzig</i>, Italian <i>frizzante</i> and French <i>pétillant</i> wines. The amount of pressure in the wine is determined by the amount of sugar added during the <a href="/Tirage" title="Tirage">tirage</a> stage at the beginning of the secondary fermentation with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford pg 272-273&#34;/&#62;</p>
