Despite its name, the Jerusalem artichoke has no relation to <a href="/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and it is not a type of <a href="/Artichoke" title="Artichoke">artichoke</a>, though the two are distantly related as members of the <a href="/Asteraceae" title="Asteraceae">daisy family</a>. The origin of the name is uncertain. Italian settlers in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> called the plant <i>girasole</i>, the Italian word for <a href="/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, because of its resemblance to the garden sunflower (both plants are members of the genus <i><a href="/Helianthus" title="Helianthus">Helianthus</a></i>). Over time, the name <i>girasole</i> (pronounced closer to <i>ʤiraː&#39;zul</i> in <a href="/Regional_Italian" title="Regional Italian">southern Italian dialects</a>) may have been changed to Jerusalem.&#60;ref name=&#34;Smith 1807&#34;&#62;{{cite book | author = <a href="/James_Edward_Smith" title="James Edward Smith">Smith, James Edward</a> | year = 1807 | title = <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_introduction_to_physiological_and_systematical_botany">An introduction to physiological and systematical botany</a> | page = 108f. | quote = A change, as I presume, of the Italian name <i>Girasole Articiocco</i>, sun-flower Artichoke, as the plant was first brought from Peru to Italy, and thence propagated throughout Europe.}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The English later corrupted girasole artichoke (meaning, &#34;sunflower artichoke&#34;) to Jerusalem artichoke. Another explanation for the name is that the <a href="/Puritans" title="Puritans">Puritans</a>, when they came to the <a href="/New_World" title="New World">New World</a>, named the plant with regard to the &#34;New Jerusalem&#34; they believed they were creating in the wilderness.&#60;ref name=&#34;LevetinEstelle&#34; /&#62; There have also been various other names applied to the plant, such as the French or Canada potato, topinambour, and lambchoke. Sunchoke, a name by which it is still known today, was invented in the 1960s by Frieda Caplan, a produce wholesaler who was trying to revive the plant&#39;s appeal.&#60;ref name=&#34;LevetinEstelle&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>The artichoke part of the Jerusalem artichoke&#39;s name comes from the taste of its edible <a href="/Tuber" title="Tuber">tuber</a>. <a href="/Samuel_de_Champlain" title="Samuel de Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a>, the French explorer, sent the first samples of the plant to France, noting its taste was similar to an <a href="/Globe_artichoke" title="Globe artichoke">artichoke</a>.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}</p>
<p><i>Handbuch des speziellen Gemüsebaus</i> attributes the name &#34;topinambur&#34; to a 17th-century coincidence at the <a href="/Vatican_City" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> (in 1615) when a sample of the tuber from Canada was on display, as having helped French Canadian settlers to survive the Winter; at the same time a member of the Brazilian coastal tribe, the <a href="/Tupinamb%C3%A1_people" title="Tupinambá people">Tupinambá</a>, was also visiting. The New World connection evidently resulted in the name for Jerusalem artichoke now used in French, German, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Jerusalem artichokes were first cultivated by the <a href="/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a> long before the arrival of the <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europeans</a>; this extensive cultivation obscures the exact native range of the species.&#60;ref name=grin/&#62; The <a href="/France" title="France">French</a> explorer <a href="/Samuel_de_Champlain" title="Samuel de Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> found domestically grown plants at <a href="/Cape_Cod" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a> in 1605. He then brought the plant back with him to France. By the mid-1600s, the Jerusalem artichoke had become a very common vegetable for human consumption in Europe and the Americas and was also used for livestock feed in Europe and colonial America.&#60;ref name=&#34;LevetinEstelle&#34; /&#62;  The French in particular were especially fond of the vegetable, which reached its peak popularity at the turn of the 19th century.&#60;ref name=&#34;LevetinEstelle&#34; /&#62;  The Jerusalem artichoke was titled &#39;best soup vegetable&#39; in the 2002 Nice Festival for the Heritage of the French Cuisine.</p>

Unlike most tubers, but in common with many other members of the <a href="/Asteraceae" title="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> (including the artichoke), the tubers store the carbohydrate <a href="/Inulin" title="Inulin">inulin</a> (not to be confused with <a href="/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a>) instead of <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a>. For this reason, Jerusalem artichoke tubers are an important source of inulin used as a <a href="/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">dietary fiber</a> in food manufacturing.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |author=Flamm G, Glinsmann W, Kritchevsky D, Prosky L, Roberfroid M |year=2001 |title=Inulin and oligofructose as dietary fiber: a review of the evidence |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=353–62 |publisher= |doi=10.1080/20014091091841 |pmid=11497328 |pmc= |url= }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Crop yields are high, typically 16–20 <a href="/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a>/<a href="/Hectare" title="Hectare">ha</a> for tubers, and 18–28 tonnes/ha green weight for foliage. Jerusalem artichoke also has potential for production of <a href="/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol fuel</a>, using <a href="/Inulin" title="Inulin">inulin</a>-adapted strains of <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> for fermentation.&#60;ref name=purdue/&#62;</p>
<p>Jerusalem artichokes are easy to cultivate, which tempts gardeners to simply leave them completely alone to grow. However, the quality of the edible tubers degrades unless the plants are dug up and replanted in fertile soil. This can be a chore, as even a small piece of tuber will grow if left in the ground, making the hardy plant a potential weed. In fact, the plant can ruin gardens by smothering or overshadowing nearby plants and can overtake huge areas if left untamed. Commercial fields growing sunchoke which then change to other vegetables or crops often must be treated with <a href="/Glyphosate" title="Glyphosate">glyphosate</a> to stop the spread of the sunchokes. Each sunchoke root can make an additional 75 to as many as 200 tubers by fall end.</p>
<p>The tubers are sometimes used as a substitute for potatoes:&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite Collier&#39;s|wstitle=Artichoke}}&#60;/ref&#62;  they have a similar consistency, and in their raw form have a similar texture, but a sweeter, nuttier flavor; raw and sliced thinly, they are fit for a salad.  The <a href="/Carbohydrates" title="Carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> give the tubers a tendency to become soft and mushy if boiled, but they retain their texture better when steamed. The inulin cannot be broken down by the human digestive system,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | author = Peter Barham | title = The Science of Cooking | page = 14. | quote = we do not possess any enzymes that are capable of breaking down larger sugars, such as raffinose etc. These 3-, 4- and 5-ring sugars are made by plants especially as part of the energy storage system in seeds and beans. If we ingest these sugars we can&#39;t break them down in the intestines, rather they travel down into the <a href="/Colon_(organ)" title="Colon (organ)">colon</a> where various <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> digest them - and in the process produce copious amounts of carbon dioxide gas}}&#60;/ref&#62; but is metabolized by bacteria in the colon. This can cause flatulence and, in some cases, gastric pain. <i>Gerard&#39;s Herbal</i>, printed in 1621, quotes the English planter <a href="/John_Goodyer" title="John Goodyer">John Goodyer</a> on Jerusalem artichokes: &#60;blockquote&#62;&#34;which way soever they be dressed and eaten, they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinking wind within the body, thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented, and are a meat more fit for swine than men.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;Gerard&#39;s Herbal, cited in Davidson A.

<p>Jerusalem artichokes have 650&#38;nbsp;mg <a href="/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> per 1 <a href="/Cup_(unit)" title="Cup (unit)">cup</a> (150g) serving.

<p>In <a href="/Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg" title="Baden-Württemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, over 90% of the Jerusalem artichoke crop is used to produce a spirit called &#34;{{ill|de|Topinambur (spirit)|lt=Topinambur|Topinambur}}&#34;, &#34;Topi&#34; or &#34;Rossler&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;C.A.R.M.E.N. e.V.: Topinambur - Energiepflanze für Biogasanlagen.

By the end of the 19th-century, Jerusalem artichokes were being used in Baden to make a spirit called  &#34;Jerusalem Artichoke Brandy&#34;, &#34;Jerusalem Artichoke&#34;, &#34;Topi&#34;, &#34;Erdäpfler&#34;, &#34;Rossler&#34;,  or &#34;Borbel&#34;.</p>
<p>Jerusalem artichoke brandy smells fruity and has a slight nutty-sweet flavour. It is characterised by an intense, pleasing, earthy note. The tubers are washed and dried in an oven before being fermented and distilled. It can be further refined to make &#34;Red Rossler&#34; by adding <a href="/Common_tormentil" title="Common tormentil">common tormentil</a>, and other ingredients such as currants, to produce a somewhat bitter and astringent <a href="/Decoction" title="Decoction">decoction</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyramid_scheme">Pyramid scheme</span></h2>
<p>In the 1980s, the Jerusalem artichoke also gained some notoriety when its seeds were planted by <a href="/Midwestern_US" title="Midwestern US">midwestern US</a> farmers at the prodding of an agricultural <a href="/Pyramid_scheme" title="Pyramid scheme">pyramid scheme</a>. There was little market for the tuber in that part of the US at the time, but farmers were assured it would soon appear on the commodities market. The only profits were realized by the initial distributors and the first few levels of farmers (who sold their seeds to subsequent levels of the pyramid). As a result, many of the farms that had planted large quantities of the crop were ruined.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;<a class="external text" href="http://nwrec.hort.oregonstate.edu/artichje.html" rel="nofollow">Jerusalem Artichoke</a>&#34;, Commercial Vegetable Production Guides, <a href="/Oregon_State_University" title="Oregon State University">Oregon State University</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Joseph Anthony Amato, <i>The Great Jerusalem Artichoke Circus: The Buying and Selling of the Rural American Dream</i>, University of Minnesota Press, 1993, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816623457" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816623457">ISBN 0-8166-2345-7</a> <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780816623457" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780816623457">ISBN 978-0-8166-2345-7</a> (paperback), <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816623449" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816623449">ISBN 0-8166-2344-9</a> <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780816623440" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780816623440">ISBN 978-0-8166-2344-0</a> (clothbound)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
