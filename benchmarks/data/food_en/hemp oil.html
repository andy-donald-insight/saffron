<p>Refined hempseed oil is clear and colorless, with little flavor and lacks natural vitamins and antioxidants. Refined hempseed oil is primarily used in body care products. Industrial hempseed oil is used in lubricants, paints, inks, fuel, and plastics. Hempseed oil has found some limited use in the production of soaps, shampoos and detergents. The oil is of high nutritional value because of its 3:1 ratio of <a href="/Omega-6" title="Omega-6">omega-6</a> to <a href="/Omega-3" title="Omega-3">omega-3</a> <a href="/Essential_fatty_acids" title="Essential fatty acids">essential fatty acids</a>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|last=Callaway|first=J.

<p>Hempseed oil is manufactured from varieties of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> that do not contain significant amounts of <a href="/Tetrahydrocannabinol" title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> (THC), the psychoactive element present in the cannabis plant. This manufacturing process typically includes cleaning the seed to 99.99% before pressing the oil. There is no THC within the hempseed, although trace amounts of THC may be found in hempseed oil when plant matter adheres to the seed surface during manufacturing. The modern production of hempseed oil, particularly in Canada, has successfully lowered THC values since 1998.&#60;ref&#62;Holler JM, et al.(2008) delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Content of Commercially Available Hemp Products. Journal of Analytical Toxicology 32: 428–432&#60;/ref&#62; Regular accredited sampling of THC in Canadian hemp seed oil shows THC levels usually below detection limit of 4&#38;nbsp;ppm (parts per million, or 4&#38;nbsp;mg/kg). Legal limit for THC content in foodstuffs in Canada is 10&#38;nbsp;ppm. Some European countries have limits of 5ppm or none-detected, some EU countries do not have such limits at all.</p>
<p><b><a href="/Hash_oil" title="Hash oil">Hash oil</a></b>, not to be confused with hempseed oil, is used for both medicinal and recreational purposes and made from the mature female flowers and leaves of the herb cannabis, thus having a much higher THC content. Hash oil should not be confused with hemp, as the modern usage of the word &#39;hemp&#39; is reserved for plants that meet the legal requirement of containing 0.3% THC or less.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web</p>

About 30–35% of the weight of <a href="/Hempseed" title="Hempseed">hempseed</a> is an edible oil that contains about 80% as <a href="/Essential_fatty_acid" title="Essential fatty acid">essential fatty acids</a> (EFAs); i.e., <a href="/Linoleic_acid" title="Linoleic acid">linoleic acid</a>, <a href="/Omega-6" title="Omega-6">omega-6</a> (LA, 55%), <a href="/Alpha-linolenic_acid" title="Alpha-linolenic acid">alpha-linolenic acid</a>, <a href="/Omega-3" title="Omega-3">omega-3</a> (ALA, 22%), in addition to <a href="/Gamma-linolenic_acid" title="Gamma-linolenic acid">gamma-linolenic acid</a>, omega-6 (GLA, 1–4%) and <a href="/Stearidonic_acid" title="Stearidonic acid">stearidonic acid</a>, omega-3 (SDA, 0–2%).</p>
<p>The proportions of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in  one tablespoon per day (15 ml) of hempseed oil easily provides human daily requirements for EFAs. Unlike <a href="/Flaxseed_oil" title="Flaxseed oil">flaxseed oil</a>, hempseed oil can be used continuously without developing a deficiency or other imbalance of EFAs. This has been demonstrated in a clinical study, where the daily ingestion of flaxseed oil decreased the endogenous production of GLA.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite pmid|17103080}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In common with other oils, hempseed oil provides 9 kcal/g. Compared with other culinary oils it is low in saturated fatty acids.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.goodwebsite.co.uk/kingsreport.pdf" rel="nofollow">King&#39;s College Review of Nutritional Attributes of Cold Pressed Hemp Seed Oil</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Highly unsaturated oils, and especially poor quality oils, can spontaneously oxidize and turn rancid within a short period of time when they are not stored properly; i.e., in a cool/cold, dark place, preferably in a dark glass bottle. Hempseed oil can be frozen for longer periods of storage time. <a href="/Preservatives" title="Preservatives">Preservatives</a> (<a href="/Antioxidants" title="Antioxidants">antioxidants</a>) are not necessary for high-quality oils that are stored properly.</p>
<p>Hempseed oil has a relatively low <a href="/Smoke_point" title="Smoke point">smoke point</a> and is not suitable for frying. Hempseed oil is primarily used as a food oil and dietary supplement, and has been shown to relieve the symptoms of a skin disease called <a href="/Eczema" title="Eczema">eczema</a> (<a href="/Atopic_dermatitis" title="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a>).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite pmid|16019622}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Hemp oil is a &#34;drying oil&#34;, as it can polymerize into a solid form. Due to its polymer-forming properties, hemp oil is used on its own or blended with other oils, resins, and solvents as an impregnator and varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty.  It has uses similar to <a href="/Linseed_oil" title="Linseed oil">linseed oil</a> and characteristics similar to <a href="/Tung_oil" title="Tung oil">tung oil</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://badger-canoe-paddles.blogspot.ca/2011/06/badger-wood-oil-why-hemp.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://badger-canoe-paddles.blogspot.ca/2011/06/badger-wood-oil-why-hemp.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
