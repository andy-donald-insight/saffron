<p>A <b>neenish tart</b> (or <b>neenish cake</b>) is a <a href="/Tart" title="Tart">tart</a> made with a <a href="/Pastry" title="Pastry">pastry</a> base and a filling consisting of sweet <a href="/Gelatine" title="Gelatine">gelatine</a>-set <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>, <a href="/Butter_cream" title="Butter cream">mock cream</a>, <a href="/Icing_sugar" title="Icing sugar">icing sugar</a> paste, or lemon and sweetened condensed milk mixture, with dried icing on the top of the tart in two colours. The addition of a layer of raspberry jam is a common recipe variation. The colours used for the icing are usually some combination of brown, white, and pink. They are almost exclusively sized as individual servings, 60–80&#38;nbsp;mm in diameter. The tart was originally created in <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and is mainly found there and in <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;The Australian Oxford Dictionary&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&#38;entry=t157.e36500" rel="nofollow">&#34;neenish tart n.&#34;</a> – <a href="/Australian_Oxford_Dictionary" title="Australian Oxford Dictionary">Australian Oxford Dictionary</a>. Accessed 23 May 2011.&#60;/ref&#62; The origin of the name &#34;neenish&#34; is unknown, though a column in the <i><a href="/Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> attributed the name to a Mrs. Ruby Neenish.&#60;ref&#62;Turpin, Andrew (2003). <a class="external text" href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/aturpin/neenish/neenish.html" rel="nofollow">Neenish Tarts</a> – University of Melbourne.

<p>The earliest known published reference to neenish tarts is a recipe in the Daily Telegraph (Launceston, Tasmania) in January 1903.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article153888749&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article153888749&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; The next known published recipe is very similar, published in the &#34;Woman&#39;s World&#34; section of <i>The Bunbury Herald</i> (based in <a href="/Bunbury%2C_Western_Australia" title="Bunbury, Western Australia">Bunbury</a>, <a href="/Western_Australia" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>) in June 1913, apparently copied from the writer&#39;s &#34;manuscript book&#34;. The recipe included an almond-based pastry, and a filling comprising a &#34;very thick custard of eggs and milk thickened with cornflour&#34;. The top of the tart consisted of coffee and vanilla icing in equal halves.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87078571" rel="nofollow">WOMAN&#39;S WORLD</a> – <i>The Bunbury Herald</i>.

Retrieved from <i>Trove</i>, 11 August 2012.&#60;/ref&#62; Another early printed recipe was in <i>Miss Drake&#39;s Home Cookery</i> published in 1929, calling for <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a> filling set with <a href="/Gelatine" title="Gelatine">gelatine</a>, and pink and white icing on top.

<p>The lemon-flavoured version of the tart most familiar to New Zealand residents is found in the <a href="/Edmonds_Cookery_Book" title="Edmonds Cookery Book">Edmonds Cookery Book</a>. It includes a filling made from butter, icing sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and lemon juice in a flour-based pastry base, topped with half standard white icing and half chocolate (cocoa added) icing.</p>
