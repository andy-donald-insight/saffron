<p>Honey Nut Clusters is part of General Mills family of Fruit &#38; Nut cereals, including <a href="/Raisin_Nut_Bran" title="Raisin Nut Bran">Raisin Nut Bran</a> and Basic 4. In 2009 the packaging on all of these cereals was updated to a different &#34;family of cereals&#34; look, however some consumers were disappointed and the company switched back to the legacy packaging currently on shelves. The recipe for this cereal was changed in April 2007, so that it no longer actually includes nuts, substituting natural almond flavoring in its place.  The picture on the box no longer depicts the same almond clusters, but the name still includes the word nut. These changes may have been implemented to counteract rising <a href="/Commodity_market" title="Commodity market">Commodity market</a> prices in 2007. It could also be presumed the recipe change was due to people&#39;s ever-expanding nut allergies.</p>
<p>A limited edition of the product called &#34;Honey Nut Clijsters&#34; was produced in 2008, with tennis player <a href="/Kim_Clijsters" title="Kim Clijsters">Kim Clijsters</a> portrayed on the box.</p>
