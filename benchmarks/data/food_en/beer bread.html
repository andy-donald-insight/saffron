<p><b>Beer bread</b> can be a simple <a href="/Quick_bread" title="Quick bread">quick bread</a> or a <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">yeast bread</a> flavored with beer. Both <a href="/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a> and <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> have a common creation process: <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> is used to turn <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugars</a> into <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>. In the case of bread a great percentage of the alcohol evaporates during the baking process.</p>
<p>Beer bread can be made with simply <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, beer, and sugar. Some bottled beers, especially <a href="/Craft_beers" title="Craft beers">craft beers</a> may intentionally have visible live, but dormant, yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, many mass market beers have the live yeast filtered out. Without sufficient <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">leavening</a> from the beer, a loaf of beer bread will be fairly dense and heavy unless an additional leavening agent, e.g., <a href="/Baking_soda" title="Baking soda">baking soda</a> and/or <a href="/Baking_powder" title="Baking powder">baking powder</a>, or <a href="/Baker&#39;s_yeast" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">baker&#39;s yeast</a> and sugar, is added. <a href="/Flour#Self-rising_flour" title="Flour">Self-raising flour</a> may be used because it is a mixture of flour and leavening agent.  Beer bread without a leavening agent is very sturdy and tends not to lose moisture if it is overcooked. The only consequence of overcooking tends to be a thicker crust.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Pre-packaged Beer Bread mixes may also be purchased with the dry ingredients and leavening agents already included.</p>
<p>Different styles of beer bread can be made by using different beers; for instance, a <a href="/Stout" title="Stout">stout</a> or <a href="/Dark_beer" title="Dark beer">dark beer</a> will give a darker bread with more pronounced flavor.  Using a beer that is spiced, or has a flavor added, will make a bread with a similar flavor, but less intense than the beer.</p>
<p>One can add any flavorings to this simple recipe when mixing the dry ingredients to enhance the flavor of bread. Some suggestions include <a href="/Cheddar_cheese" title="Cheddar cheese">cheddar</a> and <a href="/Dill" title="Dill">dill</a>, sundried tomato and herb, <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a> and <a href="/Feta" title="Feta">feta</a>, etc. A consideration when choosing flavors is that if the beer bread is not going to be eaten straight away then the flavors will become enhanced upon storage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}</p>
