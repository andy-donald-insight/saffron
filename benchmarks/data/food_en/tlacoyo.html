<p><b>Tlacoyo</b> {{IPA-es|t͡ɬaˈkoʝo|}} is an oval-shaped fried or toasted cake made of <a href="/Masa" title="Masa">masa</a>. Somewhat torpedo-shaped, they are fatter than fresh corn <a href="/Tortilla" title="Tortilla">tortillas</a> and stuffed with cooked and ground beans, cheese, <a href="/Fava_beans" title="Fava beans">fava beans</a>, <a href="/Chicharron" title="Chicharron">chicharron</a> or other ingredients. Tlacoyos can be served as an accompaniment to soups and stews or as appetizers for celebrations. Most traditional tlacoyos do not have <a href="/Lard" title="Lard">lard</a> or salt in the masa, and if not eaten soon after they are cooked, they become very tough and dry, even if reheated. On Mexican markets, vendors keep their tlacoyos warm by putting them in a covered basket, in order to keep them moist for a longer time. This dish is similar to the Salvadoran <a href="/Pupusa" title="Pupusa">pupusa</a>.</p>
<p>The name <i>tlacoyo</i> is a variation of the <a href="/Nahuatl" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> word <i>tlahtlaōyoh</i> {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬɑʔt͡ɬɑˈoːjoʔ|}}),&#60;ref name=&#34;dic&#34;&#62;<i>Nahuatl Dictionary.</i> (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved August 29, 2012, from <a class="external text" href="http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso" rel="nofollow">link</a>&#60;/ref&#62; a name given to an <a href="/Antojito" title="Antojito">antojito</a> typical of central Mexico.</p>
<p>The tlacoyo is a completely different traditional Mexican dish which must not be confused with a <i><a href="/Sope" title="Sope">sope</a></i> or a <i><a href="/Huarache_(food)" title="Huarache (food)">huarache</a></i>, but according to modern recipes,&#60;ref name=&#34;HayTlacoyos&#34;&#62;&#34;Hay Tlacoyos: Tradicional Recipes from Mexico City&#34; (2012). <a class="external text" href="http://haytlacoyos.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">link</a>&#60;/ref&#62; in some regions has started to be used in a similar way, as a base for the same ingredients used for sopes.</p>
<p>Since it is similar in shape to a huarache (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the sope and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to humid foods), Mexican street vendors, especially in Mexico City, sometimes sell it adding toppings on it, as an alternative to the sopes and huaraches. However, note the traditional tlacoyo is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it, but fresh <a href="/Salsa_(sauce)" title="Salsa (sauce)">salsa</a>. In this form they are mostly found on the streets. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}</p>
<p>Tlacoyos come in three different colors, but no artificial colors are added to its preparation. The color comes from the cornmeal used to prepare the masa which the tlacoyo is made with. The most common is blue, made with <a href="/Cornmeal" title="Cornmeal">blue corn kernels</a>.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}</p>
