<p>Angel food cake requires egg whites whipped until they are stiff; <a href="/Cream_of_tartar" title="Cream of tartar">cream of tartar</a> is added to the mixture to stabilize the egg whites.&#60;ref name=&#34;oxford&#34; /&#62; Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the egg white mixture. For this method of <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">leavening</a> to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>; <a href="/Cake_flour" title="Cake flour">cake flour</a> is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.</p>
<p>Angel food cake should be cut with a serrated knife, as a straight-edged blade tends to compress the cake rather than slice it. Forks, electric serrated knives, special tined cutters or a strong thread should be used instead.</p>

Angel food cake is usually baked in a <a href="/Cake_pan" title="Cake pan">tube pan</a>, a tall, round pan with a tube up the center that leaves a hole in the middle of the cake.&#60;ref name=&#34;oxford&#34; /&#62; A <a href="/Bundt_pan" title="Bundt pan">bundt pan</a> may also be used, but the fluted sides can make releasing the cake more difficult. The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by &#39;clinging&#39; to all sides of the pan. The angel food cake pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other cakes, this allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise.  After baking, the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">frosted</a> but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular.  Recently, many chefs (<a href="/Alton_Brown" title="Alton Brown">Alton Brown</a> in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as <a href="/Mace_(spice)" title="Mace (spice)">mace</a> and <a href="/Cloves" title="Cloves">cloves</a> to the cake.</p>

<p>Angel food cake is a white sponge cake made with only stiffly beaten egg whites (yolks would make it yellow and inhibit the stiffening of the whites) and no butter.  The first recipe in a cookbook for a white sponge cake is in Lettice Bryan’s <i>The Kentucky Housewife</i> of 1839.  Since there is no butter in the cake, the angel food cake is not related to the butter cakes: snow-drift cake, silver cake or lady cake.  </p>
<p><i>The Home Messenger Book of Tested Recipes</i>, 2d ed., 1878, by Isabella Stewart contained the first recipe for Angel’s Food Cake. Stewart’s detailed recipe called for eleven egg whites, sugar, flour, vanilla extract and cream of tartar.  &#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://researchingfoodhistory.blogspot.com/2015/04/angel-food-cake.html" rel="nofollow">Researching Food History: Angel food cake</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
