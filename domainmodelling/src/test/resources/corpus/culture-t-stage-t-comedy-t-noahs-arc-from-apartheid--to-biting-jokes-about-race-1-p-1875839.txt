
	I was born a crime,says the fast rising South African comic Trevor Noah. The personable 30-year-old means it literally. Born to a black South African mother and a white Swiss father in apartheid South Africa, his criminal status as a mixed-race child from a legally forbidden liaison has informed his worldview and his comedy.

	When he was a child, he observes, his mother would walk ahead of him in the street, pretending not to know him  I felt like a bag of weed  while his father walked on other side of the street, waving to him like a creepy paedophile.

	But his mordant riffs on race and ethnicity form just one part of his comedic repertoire. Noah is the next big thing. With material that travels well, a developed sense of stage performance, an edgy undertow to his work, and, having conquered South Africa as the countrys first comedy mega-star, he has now made dents in the US and UK markets. He makes his Irish debut tonight at the Vodafone Comedy Festival in Dublins Iveagh Gardens.

	Noah became the first African comedian to land a slot on Jay Lenos Tonight Show, which led to a rash of bookings stateside. On this side of the pond, his 2012 debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival led to a sell-out London theatre run. The producer of his Edinburgh run was one Eddie Izzard, who had caught an early club date of Noahs and was impressed enough to step in as an unofficial mentor.

	Noah didnt know who Izzard was when they first met. It was just a meeting of two comedians in a club that had no clue who the other was, which was great, he says. His endorsement has always been great because I can blackmail the audience with the phrase Well, Izzard thought that joke was hilarious.

	Reclassified racial identity

	That breakthrough Edinburgh show was called The Racist. He used the hour-long slot to lay bare his slightly surreal upbringing whereby his family had to lie to their Soweto neighbours to cover up his light- coloured skin: I was an albino, although an albino that never got sunburn.

	Because of the hateful stupidity of Apartheid, Noahs racial identity has been reclassified three times during his lifetime. Growing up, he couldnt be seen in public with his parents as they would have been arrested.

	How he deals with race material in his South African set is different from how he will treat it in Ireland. In his native country, race relations are still a hot-button topic; in Europe, it tends to be news-dependent.

	For the Dublin shows, people will find out that, as a comedian, I am shaped by where Im from and who I grew up with. In my case, that is growing up in Soweto, he says.

	But when I first started doing stand-up, I just wanted to make people laugh. That hasnt changed, but over time Ive come to realise that, while talking honestly on stage to your audience, you start to share your views and opinions on matters of the world, and that becomes a great way to connect with like-minded individuals in your audience.

	&nbsp;

	Cultural chameleon

	There is no brow-beating in Noahs work  hes not the sort of act who gets people walking out on him. He is a firm believer in the dictum that a comedians first and last purpose is to make people laugh and not be a hectoring, socially relevant buzz-kill.

	His background necessarily made him a cultural chameleon. He would speak one way to certain members of his family and in a different way to his other relations. It has helped make him a proficient mimic; dont be surprised if Irish speech patterns get put through his comedic mincer.

	Calling his show The Racist was a head-turning idea. Was this a show of or about racism? Its something he plays on well: he has a section in which his dual-identity upbringing allows him to say, Thats racist, but I can see where youre coming from. He is in talks with a US network about a sitcom based on his upbringing.

	Stand-up is still developing in South Africa, but Noahs appearance on the Jay Leno show was seen as a breakthrough for the new comedy scene in the country.

	He has long since got over the fact that hes starting again when abroad, having become accustomed to a more exalted status back home. Im unknown in more places than Im known. Im well used to that now, he says. So the luxury or curse of instant gratification is not one that Im having to face regularly.

	Noah is learning German so he can communicate with his father in his native language. He also hopes to do a stand-up show in German at some stage. He came close to growing up in Switzerland, but his mother always vetoed the idea. She wouldnt give the South African authorities the pleasure of having her leave.

	As a South African, you cant let him go without asking his opinion on the Oscar Pistorius trial. He has already got himself into trouble back home for tweeting recently And the Oscar goes to . . . jail. He mentions a superb taboo-smashing line about what he and Pistorius have in common in terms of their aspirations, but its best not to repeat that here: go along and hear it live.

	GUARANTEED LAUGHS: FIVE OF THE BEST AT VODAFONE FESTIVAL 

	&nbsp;

	Jen Kirkman 

	A fantastic talent with a regular slot on the TV show Chelsea Lately and a big-selling comedy album, Hail to the Freaks. Has a great gags-per-minute ratio and some fresh, twisted observational work.

	&nbsp;

	Milton Jones 

	If you watch TV comedy panel shows, you will already have heard a lot Joness material  he is one of the most ripped-off comics in existence. You can appreciate why: this is beautifully sculpted work from a great comedy craftsman.

	&nbsp;

	Eleanor Tiernan 

	Theres an awful lot more to her than court reporter Ursula McCarthy on Irish Pictorial Weekly: Tiernan is one of the brightest talents around, and can effortlessly mix intelligent insight with poetic filth. You wont hear better timing and delivery anywhere at the festival.

	&nbsp;

	Karl Spain 

	Consistently underrated. His nice-guy persona disguises a cutting comedy brain. He can appear a bit too laid-back at times, but he has it all, including excellent improv skills.

	&nbsp;

	Russell Howard 

	He has sold out Londons O2, and he stars in BBCs Russell Howards Good News: guaranteed laughs, then.
